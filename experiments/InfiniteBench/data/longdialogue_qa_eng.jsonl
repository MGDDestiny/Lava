{"id": 0, "context": "BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD Written by Lucy Alibar & Benh Zeitlin\n\n\nFINAL DRAFT: Based on the stage play \"Juicy and Delicious\" by Lucy Alibar \n\n\nEXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAWN An abandoned looking trailer sits on top of two 15-foot-tall oil drums. Distant thunder trembles through the peeling metal panels. The structure is in such disrepair, that surely no one lives here. But then, a light goes on. \n\n\nINT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - MORNING A tiny hand sculpts the mud on top of a crawfish hole placed on the floor. We pan up to reveal a little girl examining a baby chicken that appears to be dead. This is HUSHPUPPY, an unkempt and seemingly uncared for six-year-old with a gaze of unmistakable wisdom. Hushpuppy places the chick on the crawfish hole, like a queen on her throne and the chick twitches to life, cheeps twice. Hushpuppy's esoteric science experiment is interrupted by DISTANT THUNDER. Her eyes stand to attention. \n\n\nCUT TO: EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY An eerie, harsh wind whips hay and dust through over a giant slumbering pot-belly pig. Hushpuppy, donned in boys' underpants and a child-sized wife- beater, tip-toes behind the epic creature. She studies it, wonderful, is this the source of the thunder? With the utmost delicacy, she lays a hand on the pig's belly. We hear his HUGE BEATING HEART. \n\n\nCUT TO: EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - VARIOUS A series of glimpses of Hushpuppy's scientific method. She chases geese, chickens, ducks, dogs around the property- a cross between an abandoned farm and salvage yard. Hushpuppy grabs a baby chick and puts it to her ear. A TINY HEARTBEAT. She listens with focused wonder and intensity HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) All the time, everywhere, everything's organs be beatin' and squirtin' and talkin' to each other in ways I can't understand. Mosta the time they probably just sayin' \"I'm hungry,\" or \"I gotta poop,\" but sometimes they talkin' in codes. Hushpuppy's eyes dart up as a MAN'S VOICE yells- MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Get up, get out of here! We hear a YOWL as a cat is flung across the room. A window made from a gas station sign opens in a Robinson Crusoe style tree house patched together from storm debris and discarded appliances. A wild man with severe features, a frazz of unkempt hair, and brawler's scars opens a window made from a metal sign. This is WINDELL EMMETT DOUCET, known to all as WINK .\n\n\nWINK: Get your pants on, man! Wink kills a beer and sends it out the hole in the wall into a basketball hoop attached to a fishing net that stretched 15 feet down to the ground. The net is overflowing with beer cans. \n\n\n\nEXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY Hushpuppy obediently climbs a series of increasingly bigger and bigger oil drums that function like a ladder, up to the door of her house. \n\n\nEXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY We now see Wink in his morning ritual. He opens a cooler with a butchered chicken inside it and tosses the bird on the grill. He goes to the front porch and pours down a bag of dog food. He pulls a clothesline that leads to Hushpuppy's trailer. A BELL RINGS\n\n\nWINK: Feed up time! Feed up! Hushpuppy, now wearing pants and a slightly more proper T- shirt, comes running down the oil barrels to her house. She echoes her Daddy.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Feed up time! Feed up! \n\n\nINT. ABANDONED BUS - DAY Hushpuppy devours the whole roast chicken with her hands, getting right in there like it was a candy apple. It looks really yummy. Pigs, dogs, chickens, and cats are chowing down all around her. A hatch opens above her and we realize we're in the bottom of the Shacko. Wink sticks his head through the hatch and throws corn to the chickens.\n\n\nWINK: Share with the dogs. Hushpuppy rips off a piece of chicken and flings it to a filthy chihuahua with no hair on the back half of its body. This is WINDELL, in spite of her circumstances, quite a handsome young pup. \n\n\nEXT. BATHTUB MARSH WATER - THE TURCK - EVENING WIDE, we see Hushpuppy and Wink drift through the marsh. They ride in a severed truck bed floating on top of oil drums. A motor is strapped to the back. A sign on the boat reads \"The Turck\", Hushpuppy's spelling of \"Truck\". They look out to where the water goes all the way to a monolithic, 20 foot wall stretching infinitely into the distance. This levee, the first piece of modern construction we've seen, encloses the civilized world, protecting it from rising water. The Bathtub is on the wrong side of wall. Wink stares out at the distant factories behind the wall with a peaceful and confident disdain. Hushuppy matches his relaxed defiant expression\n\n\nWINK: Ain't that ugly over there? He takes a long pull on his beer.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) We live in the prettiest place on earth. Hushpuppy looks over the wall to the Dry Side. It's an endless sprawl of oil processing power plants without a tree or bird in sight. This is the engine that runs the Northern world. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy says, up above the levee, on the dry side, they're afraid of the water like a bunch of babies. They built the wall that cuts us off. \n\n\nEXT. AERIAL BATHTUB - DAY We fly over marsh and water, coming upon a tiny crop of shanties on an island perched at the very bottom of the land. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They think we all gonna drown down here. But we ain't goin' nowhere. \n\n\nCUT TO: EXT. CAUSEWAY - PRE-FLOOD - DAY CLOSE ON Hushpuppy letting out a WARRIOR SCREAM in a mass of HOLLERING people. They stand on a long and crumbling road surrounded on both sides by water. The rag tag band of revelers charge forward WHOOPING and SHOUTING. Hushpuppy kisses her hand and smacks the town sign. \"Isle de Charles Doucet\" is crossed out and someone has graffitied \"The Bathtub.\" Each party-goer repeats Hushpuppy's kiss and smack in wild, ritualistic fashion. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The Bathtub's got more holidays than the whole rest of the world EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY The townspeople charge in a rousing parade. Everyone drags trails of beer cans, boat parts, anything they can tie to themselves that makes a lot of noise. They are the hard faces of fishermen and their feisty wives, downtrodden but with a sense of fortitude among them, a community of heart, spirit, passion, and reckless abandon. We see none of the separations that we're used to in modern society. There is no evidence of politics, religion, class, race or any other divisive ideology. The Bathtub is a place of true and honest unity. Megaphones sticking out a gutted mini-van broadcast the Cajun band playing inside. Fiddle, saw, guitar, and double-bass players struggle to hold onto their instruments and the truck bounces them down a dirt road. They drive under a banner reading \"Welcome to the Bathtub Storm Season!\" Wink and Hushpuppy rattle along on a float made from the front end of a pickup truck. Over the front cabin rears a giants sculpture of a horse-head made out of wooden spikes, metal plates, and heavy chains. Carnival-dressed maniacs clamber on top. Wink hollers and waves to people. He fires jets of beer into the mouths of the crowd. Hushpuppy dances on the back of the float. Though she's the tiniest member of this very adult parade, she's right in the thick of everything. No one is checking I.Ds Here. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy always saying, that up in the dry world, they got none of what we got. \n\n\nEXT. LAFOURCHE SQUARE - DAY The town dances around the band in a clearing in the woods. Everyone is bouncing to the music, smiling and joking with one another. \n\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They only got holidays once a year Six babies, each with a racing number pinned to their diaper, are placed by their enthusiastic mammas at a starting-line on a track marked by two adjacent crowds of onlookers. Bets are flying between the spectators as if they're about to watch a cock-fight. \n\n\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O.) All babies to the race! Come up to the starting line! The baby race is about to begin. Hushpuppy dances in the cheering crowd, swigging a bottle of something she probably shouldn't have. A STARTING GUN fires, and the babies make a crawl for it. Most of them are paralysed in tears or bewilderment, but one brave soul toddles towards victory. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They got fish stuck in plastic wrappers, they got their babies stuck in carriages, and chickens on sticks and all that kind of stuff. Hushpuppy looks up at Wink who is dancing with his best friend WALRUS , a slack jawed, white haired, pinked nosed, handsome devil. A baby crosses the finish line, ahead of the rest, victorious. The crowd goes wild. EXT. MARINA PAUPIER NET - NIGHT Wink opens his trawl net and dumps a massive catch into a picking pan. There's food to feed a hundred in the haul. No one is a bit fazed though, this is just your average night fishing in the Bathtub. Shrimp, crabs, and small leaping fish struggle over one another for dear life. Hushpuppy helps him sort the catch. Winks's hands move with virtuosic ease, separating the crabs from the shrimp. She studies Wink's every move and tries to measure up to her Dad's proficiency. He doesn't demonstrate or explain anything, but we sense there is a system of education in place here Hushpuppy focuses in on a tiny fish, wriggling and sucking it's last breaths of air. \n\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) One day, the storm's gonna blow, the ground's gonna sink, and the water's gonna rise up so high, there ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a whole bunch of water. She pick up a crab, pets its belly. The DIN of the party fades down around her as she listens to its HEARTBEAT. EXT. LADY JO'S CYPRESS FOREST - NIGHT Explosions everywhere as Bathtubers rampage blasting fireworks down the street instead of into the air. Men dressed as women, women dressed as men, in some kind of reckless esoteric ritual. The SCORE kicks in hard with a tinge of ominous forboding. We sense that in spite of the ecstatic energy, the unbridled joy, that a cloud hangs over this community. The people are parting like it's there last day on earth, and we feel viscerally, that it could be. Hushpuppy runs in the thick of it behind Wink waving a fountain sparkler. Wink trips and falls. Wink lies on his back on the ground. He sees his daughter watching him, holding the huge sparkler, and they both laugh with sheer joy. Hushpuppy stops over him and points a bottle rocket in his face, the fuse burning. He nods his approval. They watch the fuse burn down to the last moment. She turns it upward, and they watch her rocket join a sky filled with pluming mortars. Hushpuppy looks at the light flickering across Wink's faces. He's momentarily peaceful, admiring the spectacular display. Hushpuppy smiles at him with pride. He doesn't see her. They run off into the crowd, which is pulsating at the pinnacle of mayhem. The OMINOUS MUSIC shifts gears into a BLASTING PATRIOTIC HYMN of the Bathtub. Throw your fist in the air! These are the survivors, those who fight for their joy and their history to the last man HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) But me and my Daddy, we stay right here. We who the earth is for. Hushpuppy runs right at us with detonating fireworks in both hands, engulfed by light. She swings them toward camera and the screen is engulfed in an inferno of sparks. A white out. Black letters slam down. BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD INT. SCHOOLBOAT - MORNING MUSIC CUTS abruptly as a basket of crawfish is slammed in front of camera. The crawfish squirming and struggling for life engulfs the screen.\n\n\nWOMAN'S VOICE: Meat. A fearsome, uncompromising leader, sexy like a lady bullfighter, peeks at Hushpuppy over a mass of squirming crawfish. This is MISS BATHSHEBA . She points to three students, pushing their heads with her finger, each time announcing:\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: MEAT. MEAT. MEAT. The twelve students follow her through a maze of creatures caged in mason jars, basins, and boxes with breathing holes- her educational tools. \n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Every animal is made out of meat. I am meat, ya'll asses meat. Everything is part of the buffet of the universe. Miss Bathsheba rolls up the leg of her skirt. \n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) This here, is an Aurochs. Riding her thigh, is tattooed a scene much like a cave painting in Lascaux. In thick black ink, it depicts a battle between early men wielding spears, and giant bull-like animals bearing down over them\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) A fierce, mean creature that roamed the earth back when we all lived in caves. They would gobble the cave- babies down right in front of their cave-parents. And the cavemen couldn't do nothing about it, because they were too poor, too stupid, too small. Who here thinks the Cavemen were sitting around crying like a buncha pussies? Children stare blankly, no one raises their hand. Hushpuppy watches a heroic crawfish crest the basket, fall to the floor, and make a run for it. Miss Bathsheba snatches up the rogue crawdad and flings it back into the vat. \n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Y'all better think about that. Cause any day now, the fabric of the universe is coming unraveled. The ice caps gonna melt, the water's gonna rise, and everything south of the levee's going under. She points to a map showing a ragged coastline. On the wrong side of a giant line marked \"levee\" is an island labeled \"The Bathtub.\" \n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a whole bunch of water. Y'all better learn to survive. A mysterious COLD WIND fills the air. Hushpuppy stares into a wall poster of an ice cliff reading: THE SOUTH POLE. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Way back in the day, the Aurochs was king of the world. EXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF - DAY CRASH CUT to the PANORAMA of an ice cliff, but now it's real We CUT CLOSER to overwhelming white light accompanied by intermittent FROZEN CRACKS that build in frequency and volume. \n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) If it wasn't for giant snowballs, and the iced age. I wouldn't even be Hushpuppy, I would just be breakfast. The light dims in intensity to reveal, frozen deep inside the ice wall, barely visible- a fanged, hairy, bloated, stone aged creature, the same as on Miss Bathsheba's leg. This is an Aurochs. INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - EVENING Hushpuppy climbs a metal ladder made from a railing, up to Wink's shanty in the trees. Windell, her dirty Chihuahua, follows behind.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Daddy? Feed-up time. Feed-up? Hushpuppy bangs on the door of the shacko.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) Daddy? Nothing. She goes inside. The house is empty. She checks the Shacko for food. Nothing. EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - EVENING Several hours later, Hushpuppy stands on a metal bin looking into the distance.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: DADDY!? Like some sort of animal call, she SHRIEKS\n\n\nINT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - NIGHT Hushpuppy draws a picture of Wink on a foldout mattress... HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Kids that got no Mamma, no Daddy and nobody. They got to live in the woods, and eat grass, and steal underpants. Hushpuppy lays down next to her drawing of Wink. EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - MORNING Windell, the Chihuahua and the potbelly pig awake to greet the day. Hushpuppy peers into the ground floor of the shacko.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Daddy? Daddy? No response. \n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) (CONT'D) If Daddy don't get home soon, it's gonna be time for me to start eating my pets. EXT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY Kids walk home with their parents after a day at the Schoolboat, which we now see is big a yellow houseboat floating on the bayou. Hushpuppy waits alone, no one has come to get her. Miss Bathsheba locks up the door and heads for her small motor boat tied off on the side of the school.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: You need a ride, boo?\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: My Daddy's coming to pick me up.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: How about food or something, you hungry?\n\n\nHushpuppy shakes her head `no'. Miss Bathsheba's doesn't totally believe her, but she's not the type to coddle either. \n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Alright, well suit yourself. Miss Bathsheba motors away. Hushpuppy waits until she's out of sight and starts walking. \n\n\n\nINT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - MORNING Playing don't-touch-the-floor, Hushpuppy navigates her house. The room has with holes in the walls blocked with old clothes and paper towels. Homemade toys fill every surface. This is the domain of a child at loose ends. Hushpuppy leaps over her bed- a nook piled with clothes- and plugs in the Christmas lights. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O) Everything we still got from Mamma, we keep in my house. We push in on a shrine to her mother: A red basketball jersey. An apron. A sawed-off shotgun. A child's drawing of a beautiful lady. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Daddy says, the first time she looked at me, it made her heart beat so big, that she thought it would blow up. That's why she swam away. Hushpuppy takes the jersey down. She puts it over a chair in the dining area. Hushpuppy gets a can of cat food. A pot. Water in a bowl. Her actions have a sad sense of routine to them- she's been left alone before, and has her own self-invented system for feeding herself. She opens a can of cat food, takes it out with her hand and throws it in a pot. She licks the remnants off her finger\n\n\nMARIETTA'S VOICE: Hi my sweet baby.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Hi momma. MARIETTA, Hushpuppy's imaginary, invisible mamma, is speaking from the basketball jersey chair. Marietta functions like an imaginary friend- Hushpuppy is the only one who can see her. Hushpuppy takes the pot, puts it on the stove.\n\n\nMARIETTA'S VOICE: Hushpuppy what you doing there? You being good like I taught you?\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Yes, mamma. Hushpuppy turns on the gas. Hushpuppy goes through her safety precautions: oven mitts, a helmet, she flips the table and hides behind it. She aims the stove lighter: a flame thrower made from a cigarette lighter and a can of spray deodorant. A spray of flames ignites the stove in a FIREBALL. \n\n\nCUT TO: MOMENTS LATER. Hushpuppy behind the bubbling stove. She ties on an apron and sways to the music. She is dressing like her mom. Marietta's Voice sings to her.\n\n\nMARIETTA'S VOICE: You're good, you make me happy / you're good, you make me happy.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: That's pretty Mamma.\n\n\nMARIETTA'S VOICE: You're pretty Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy stares into the floating islands of cat food frying in fat, which in her POV is a surreal churning vision, like the bubbling lava at the center of the earth. She's SHOCKED out of her vision by a YOWLING CAT being flung across the yard\n\n\nWINK (O.S) Get out of my way you fat animal! Hushpuppy jumps down from the stove, grabs a bowl of water, and runs to greet Wink, \n\n\nEXT. WINK'S COMPOUND - MORNING She clambers down the oil drum ladder spilling her water everywhere in her excitement.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Daddy! Daddy, Daddy! Wink doesn't turn to acknowledge her as he trudges across the field toward his Shacko. He's wearing a hospital patient's smock and no shoes, it seems he checked himself out.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) I learned lots of stuff while you gone. If I drink all this here I can burp like a man. Hushpuppy gulps down water, all of it. Wink keeps walking. Hushpuppy BURPS like a man, but he doesn't turn around. Hushpuppy stops to examine the situation. Something's not right here.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) How come you wearing a dress? Hushpuppy tugs his patient's smock and he shrugs her off violently.\n\n\nWINK: Leave me alone, Man. She sees his hospital I.D bracelet still on.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: You wearing a bracelet too?\n\n\nWINK: Go in your house, you wouldn't understand.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I wanna come in your house\n\n\nHushpuppy whacks Wink's butt.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) I WANNA COME IN YOUR HOUSE! Wink fakes like he's gonna smack her.\n\n\nWINK: GO AHEAD! Hushpuppy tears off. Wink storms into the Shacko in the Backo. \n\n\nINT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY Hushpuppy stomps inside. Her cat food is burning, with steam jetting up to the ceiling. She thinks about it for a moment, and turns the burner up. Smoke billows. Hushpuppy grabs her basketball jersey off the chair and jumps over the breakfront counter. Behind her A MASSIVE GREASE EXPLOSION. Hushpuppy ducks down, panicking. She check over the median. The stove is on engulfed in flames. Hushpuppy scrambles under a cardboard box. \n\n\nINT./EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S BOX - DAY The walls of the box are decorated with years of her drawings. In here she feels a strange safety. The FLAMES and BREAKING WINDOWS feel distant and muffled. She draws a hieroglyphic of herself sad and crying on an island with a sun and a palm tree. She peeks out as Wink runs into the house, which is filled with black smoke, flickering flames. \n\n\nWINK (O.S.) (panicking from inside) Hushpuppy!? Boss lady!? Hushpuppy where you at!? Hushpuppy drops the box closed. Smoke billows into the box, filling it up\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O) If Daddy kill me, I ain't gonna be forgotten, I'm recording my story for the scientists of the future. Hushpuppy draws a bigger figure giving her a hug as Wink's panicked fury intensifies outside. \n\n\nWINK (O.S) HUSHPUPPY!? Where are you Boss!? \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O) In a million years, when kids go to school, they gonna know that once there was Hushpuppy and she lived with her Daddy in the Bathtub. Wink pulls Hushpuppy's drawings off the walls, he flings them out the door to safety. Hushpuppy coughs. Wink has heard. He looks toward the box.\n\n\nWINK: BOSS LADY? Hushpuppy and makes a runs for it, flying out the door.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Don't you run away from me. I swear to GOD Hushpuppy! EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY Hushpuppy runs out of Wink's compound into the woods, Wink on her trail. In the background, the house is a towering inferno. \n\n\nEXT. TRAIL BEHIND WINK'S COMPOUND - DAY They run deeper into the swamp.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I'm tearing off!\n\n\nWINK: You ain't tearing off nothin', I'll bust your ass!\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I'm tearing off just like my Momma.\n\n\nWINK: Come on! Wink tried to yank her toward home and Hushpuppy refuses. She digs her heels in.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) See what happens. See what happens to you! Hushpuppy hooks her leg around a tree and holds on. Wink slaps Hushpuppy and she falls face down. He looks away, disgusted with himself.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) See what you making me do? You're killing me! He reaches down and tries to pick her up.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Get up and now come on. Hushpuppy jumps up on her own.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I hope you do die! And after you die, I come to your grave and eat birthday cake all by myself! Hushpuppy punches Wink in the heart and suddenly EVERYTHING GOES QUIET, as if all the insects in the forest have hushed. All at once, we hear-- A HUMAN HEART, beating until there is a SONIC BOOM, an earsplitting CRACK of glacial ice. Hushpuppy turns toward the sound. When she turns back Wink's face has transformed, wrenches with fear and pain. Wink keels over clutching his arm. Hushpuppy stares, her breath accelerating. Wink's eyes roll back in his head, he begins to seizure\n\n\nANOTHER GLACIAL CRACK rings out. The SPLITTING builds to a DEAFENING ROAR. She covers her ears. \n\nEXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF / WOODS - DAY Fissures appear like lightning through the massive ice cliff from the opening of the movie. Hushpuppy runs from the sound, hands over her ears. We INTERCUT with shots of falling glaciers. The universe is coming unravelled. An ice shelf COLLAPSES into the ocean in a MASSIVE AVALANCHE, a wave rolls toward camera. EXT. GRAVEYARD BY THE WATER - DAY The wave, now just a tiny ripple, hits Hushpuppy's feet. Suddenly, the water level rises around her. It overtakes her knees and keeps going. Hushpuppy backs up to shore, terrified. Hushpuppy calls out to a distant beacon flashing on the horizon.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Momma!? Momma!? MOMMA!? I think I broke something. \n\n\nEXT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY Hushpuppy runs out of the woods toward school in a total panic. In front of the school parents pile their children into a pickup trucks and vans.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Miss Bathsheba! Miss Bathsheba! My Daddy fell down! Miss Bathsheba takes Hushpuppy's hands as she tries to catch her breath to speak. Clutched in her hand is the hospital bracelet that Wink had been wearing. Bathsheba turns over the diagnostic bracelet and reads it, her eyes widen in recognition and alarm\n\n\nINT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY Hushpuppy watches Miss Bathsheba frantically pull herbs and roots from her containers of medicinal oddities and pack it into a large medicine jar.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: It's gonna be OK baby. Bathsheba hands Hushpuppy the medicine jar. \n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Ok, Hushpuppy, here's what I need you to do. You take this medicine and run as fast as you can. Go! \n\n\nEXT. SWAMP CLEARING - DAY We see glimpses of nature protecting itself from the impending disaster. Flowers curl up, insects horde food underground, RUSTLING sounds fill the air. Black birds, and bats, and all manner of flying creatures fill the sky. They're all getting the hell out of dodge. Hushpuppy, quaking with fear, runs through a menacing swamp clutching her medicine jar. The rising winds swirl the marsh grass all around her. Hushpuppy runs to the spot where Wink collapsed. He's gone. Hushpuppy looks around the swamp, unable to understand. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy could have turned into a tree, or a bug. There wasn't any way to know. Hushpuppy hides her medicine jar in her storage unit- a leather flap laid over the hollow of an oak tree. The hollow is filled with trinkets and objects she's collected over the years. Hushpuppy flinches as a shrieking animal calls out. She looks up to see a leaf covered in writhing caterpillars. One of them has been skewered by a beetle and is fighting for it's life\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The whole universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If one piece busts, even the smallest piece, the entire universe will get busted. \n\n\nEXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF - DAY Blocks of glaciers roll out of the avalanche and away from Antarctica like floating ice cubes. Embedded in each cube, is an Aurochs. A single ice cube takes over the frame and the mammoth dead Aurochs' eye stares right at us. Its jaw wide, its fangs bared, the ferocious beast appears to have fossilized mid- pounce. THUNDER BOOMS. We drift upwards into the cloud cover. As we rise above the white canopy, the spiral of a hurricane forms. \n\n\nEXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY STRINGS SWELL under HOWLING WINDS. We follow behind a little boy running down the road with an alarm bell as the people of the Bathtub mobilize in a frenzied evacuation.\n\n\nBOY: The storm's coming! The storm's coming! \n\nEXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY Hushpuppy sulks out of the woods, feeling sorry for herself. She looks up and freezes like she's seen a ghost. Wink hobbles down the road, looking shell-shocked. The traffic on the road moves in one direction: out. Wink walks back into town in the opposite direction. \n\n\nIn Hushpuppy's POV Wink arrives at Lady Jo's bar where a band of drunken sweethearts are in their regular positions. They are watching the evacuation go by like it's a Veteran's Day parade. They giggle and hurl good-natured curses out to a family making their way to safety\n\n\nLITTLE JO: Look at these assholes running around all over the damn place. C'est la vie assholes!\n\n\nWINK: I know y'all with me. Y'all doin' the storm.\n\n\nLITTLE JO: Lady Jo's ain't never closed honey.\n\n\nWINK: That's what I'm talking about. Walrus my big man, you staying?\n\n\nWALRUS: Wrong number buddy. I'm outta here as soon as I finish my beer. Wink dismisses him with a wave of his hand.\n\n\nWINK: You ain't goin nowhere.\n\n\nWALRUS: This ain't no sneeze comin' out the gulf. I'm gone brother.\n\n\nWINK: I'll see you tomorrow Walrus. Lookit there, Winston's with me. WINSTON is passed out on the stairs.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) What you doing about the storm Winston? Without opening his eyes, Winston raises an umbrella over his head. Wink laughs.\n\n\nWALRUS: Hey! It's Hushpuppy.\n\n\nEVERYBODY: Hushpuppy! Hushpuppy's here. They burst into a round of drunken applause\n\n\nWINK: Hushpuppy? Where you been?\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: What happened to y-\n\n\nWINK: Shut-up! He lifts her up by the britches and carries her away.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) You don't talk! INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - GROUND FLOOR - DAY Through the bus window, Hushpuppy watches Wink prepare for the storm as branches and debris fly by him. He RANTS to himself and drinks. He ties the Turck onto the house. Hushpuppy looks to where her animals lurch and freeze, run around in circles, pant heavily. They feel it coming. Rain drops start to spatter the window and Wink trips and falls trying to catch a fleeing chicken. \n\n\nINT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - 2ND FLOOR - NIGHT Now, the full force of the storm HOWLS and CLATTERS the shutters. Rain screams against the corrugated metal roof. Wink tapes padding over all sharp corners and plastic wraps the furniture. He's Hushpuppy-proofing everything. He runs a piece of duct tape across the floor.\n\n\nWINK: This side is still Wink's house. No toys, and no girl stuff over here. Wink pushes charred toys from Hushpuppy's house across the line.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) So if I want to come over that side and smack you in the face, that's against the rules. So there's a plus for you\n\n\nHushpuppy is not able to see the bright side here.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Now come on down here and get in the boat, man. He points to a trunk on the floor. Hushpuppy hops down and gets in. Wink sits on his air mattress.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) If the water get real high, we gonna float to the top and we gonna bust through the roof and we gonna ride away, okay? Wink puts a pair of mismatching water wings on her.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) You never NEVER take these off. I'm your Daddy, and you do what I tell you to do, because it's my job to keep you from dying, ok? So sit back and just listen to me... Close your eyes and go to sleep. CLOSE YOUR EYES! Hushpuppy watches Wink pretending to sleep. The THUNDER scares the bejesus out of him again. She looks to the ceiling where water is starting to pour in steadily. Looks back at Wink who is sneaking a sip from his liquor bottle. He resumes his phony sleep. A strong gust of wind JOLTS the entire room and he springs out of bed.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Why you starin' at me like that? I can't sleep with you starin' at me like that. Wink paces the floor.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Listen. You need to understand, you're a kid and I'm a man. She doesn't understand\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) What, you scared? Hushpuppy nods. THUNDER BOOMS and Wink is the one who flinches.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Don't be scared, no storm can't beat no Doucet. I'm gonna show you. You watch. But he can see she's still scared.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) I'm'll show you! We Doucets we're not scared of no damn storm. Wink grabs a bottle of moonshine and climbs down the hatch in the floor into the storm. Hushpuppy runs to the window and peeks out. OUTSIDE. The frenzy of the hurricane propels Wink at full sprint through the 100 MPH winds. He tears his clothes off and guzzles moonshine as branches fall all around him.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Look at me! Look at me Hushpuppy! Watch me kick butt. Wink fires his shotgun at the heavens.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Hell yea! I'm right here! I'm right here I ain't going nowhere. AHHHHHH!!! A THUNDER CLAP shakes the house so hard a ceiling beam CRASHES down. Hushpuppy runs to her bed as if it might keep her safe. Windell, swinging from a basket tied to the ceiling, BARKS, panicking herself.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Mamma!? MAMMA!? \n\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n25 EXT. PATAGONIAN COAST - NIGHT Still in the rainstorm, a glacial cube SHATTERS, flopping a mammoth body onto the shoreline. It's chest heaves and a LOW SNORT is heard. The animal begins to roll over. Her dinosaur size hoof plants in the mud as she lifts herself up. We stare over the muscular haunch of her body as she stares into the distance. The massive creature turns, testing her limbs after thousands of years of sleep. She looks up to the storm and lets loose a GURGLING ROAR. We sit close on one of her black eyes. There is something dangerously sad in her cold gaze. Her head moves from the frame as she starts forward on her journey. \n\n\nEXT. AERIAL BATHTUB - DAY Silence. The storm has passed. The camera flies high over the Bathtub. The tops of houses poke out from the massive water like lily-pads in a pond. \n\n\nEXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - FLOODED - MORNING A slab of metal stares at us, surrounded by water. Something under the metal BANGS TWICE and an axe dislodges a roof panel. The axe twists and leverages off the slab. Wink hefts Hushpuppy on top of the roof. Then Windell. Dishevelled and hung-over, he pulls himself up too. The three survivors stare in stunned silence at their new world. \n\n\nEXT. FLOODED LAFOURCHE ROAD - TURCK - MORNING Wink slowly navigates the Turck in through the flooded landscape where their town had once been. Neither he nor Hushpuppy can say a word. Everything is submerged. Every organism is dead or has fled. The quiet is overwhelming \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) For every animal that didn't have a Dad to put it in a boat, the end of the world already happened. They're all down below, trying to breathe through water. They pass abandoned house, after abandoned house, the ones on stilts have water up to the porches. Trees are bashed through roofs, walls are blown through, bathrooms exposed. \n\n\nEXT. WINSTON'S HOUSE - FLOODED - MORNING Wink uses a pole to open a door.\n\n\nWINK: Yo Winston? No one answers. They push off. \n\nEXT. EDISON'S HOUSE - FLOODED - THE TURCK - DAY Wink enters an intact house with water up to the porch. \n\n\nWINK (O.S.) Edison? Ow-Wee! Wink leans against the door frame. From his POV we see Hushpuppy on the Turck. She picks a leaf and eats it. Wink shakes his head in dismay, realizing all too clearly his girl is not ready for survival. \n\n\nEXT. SWAMP - THE TURCK - DAY The Turck passes through a net of Spanish moss into the belly of a swamp.\n\n\nWINK: Some day when I'm gone, you gonna be the last man in the bathtub. You have to learn how to feed your house. Wink goes to the edge of the turck and sticks his hand in the water\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Now, stick your left hand in this water, stick it in there. Hushpuppy puts her right hand in the water.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Ok, what you do is you hold your hand steady and you just wait for your fish to come. You gotta ball your fist up, this is your punching hand. Ball your fist up in case you have to whack it when they come up. Wink pulls a Catfish out with his bare hand.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) WHOOOOO YEA! Whooo lord, look what we got. I gotcha. Say \"I gotcha!\"\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I gotcha! Wink slams the fish down on the floor of the Turck and pins it.\n\n\nWINK: Yea! Hold him down! Now, you hold it down like this, and whack him good with your fist. Wink pins the fish and punches it in the face.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Go ahead whack him! You whack him good. Hold him like that and whack him! Hushpuppy pins the fish. She tries to whack it and it cuts her.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: OW! She hides her cut hand from Wink.\n\n\nWINK: You OK? That's all a part of it\n\n\nHushpuppy winces in pain.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) You wanna try it again? Hushpuppy shakes her head no, trying not to cry.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Come on. One more time. INT. EDISON'S HOUSE - FLOODED - NIGHT Hushpuppy has enclosed herself under a table with a tablecloth on it. She's drawing on the floor with charcoal. Something alive hits the roof and scurries across. We hear the entire house MOAN, or was it a distant ROAR?\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Daddy? Wink's hacking cough, which has gotten worse since last we heard it, fills the room. Hushpuppy tries to shake him awake. Hushpuppy looks through the gap in his shirt. On Wink's chest, surrounding his heart, a corroded spider web of purple bruises shows through the skin, like varicose veins covering his entire heart. Hushpuppy's eyes go wide with horror. \n\n\nEXT. EDISON'S HOUSE - NIGHT The beacon pulses on the distant horizon.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Mamma? Is that you? The beacon does not respond.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) I've broken everything\n\n\nEXT. DESERT - DAY A cloud of dust circulates particles. The Haze is blinding. A distant RUMBLING grows. Dark shapes tear through the haze in a deafening stampede. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Strong animals, they know when your hearts are weak. That makes them hungry and they start coming. We see one at first, then more join rank around it. The Aurochs are charging in a pack. They are a biblical terror; the horsemen of the apocalypse. \n\n\nEXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY The turck moves through the cypress forest, signs are strewn everywhere pointing to Lady Jo's bar. It appears abandoned. Suddenly, the door SQUEAKS open. Walrus winces at the sunlight and pops a beer. He steps out the door and SPLASHES into the water.\n\n\nWALRUS: Holy bowlegged Sarah!\n\n\nWINK: Hey partner! Hey Walrus! Wink pulls in the Turck and paddles to rescue the thrashing drunkard. They leverage Walrus aboard and lay him out on deck.\n\n\nWALRUS: (gauging his surroundings) I musta passed out. Wink starts chuckling silently. His chuckle builds to a laugh. \n\n\nINT. LADY JO'S BAR - FLOODED - DAY They enter the bar, empty bottles, half eaten crabs, and general party debris are littered everywhere\n\n\nLittle Jo is sprawled on the floor under a table. Is she dead or just wasted?\n\n\nWINK: Little Jo! She awakes with a start and bangs her head on the table.\n\n\nLITTLE JO: Wink!? Wink and Walrus run to help her up. \n\nLITTLE JO (CONT'D) (TO WALRUS) You don't touch me you filthy bastard! (TO WINK) Wink, you get me. They both lift her. \n\nLITTLE JO (CONT'D) Goin' on all night `bout how tonight's the last night on earth we gotta make it count. Talkin' dirty right in front of Peter T.\n\n\nWALRUS: Sorry Peter T. Peter T enters from the Bathroom.\n\n\nWINK: Peter T, my man! I knew you wasn't gonna leave me man! Peter T speaks in his polite, level-headed, soft sweet voice.\n\n\nPETER T: Oh no, oh no.\n\n\nWALRUS: (re: Peter T) That is one classic dude right there.\n\n\nWINK: Peter T, you are a titan! Glad you stayed man! RHHAAAA! 31\n\n\nWink jiggles Peter T's ample belly. Peter T giggles with glee. Wink puts one arm around Walrus and the other around Peter T. He smiles to Hushpuppy. She laughs too, the first smile in quite some days. \n\nINT. LADY JO'S BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT The Bathtub crew are lolling in the later party stages. There is a rooster on the table looking like the most sober creature in the room by far.\n\n\nWALRUS: If I had wings, I know I could have flown in that bad boy. But I would have probably bounced off a tree, or... Hushpuppy lays on the table in pile of empty crab shells.\n\n\nWINK: Hushpuppy! Did I ever tell you the story of your conception? The bar crowd chuckles.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) When me and Hushpuppy's Mamma first met we was so shy, we used to sit around, and drink beer, and smile at each other. One day we was so shy we just napped... Wink's voice FADES DOWN as Hushpuppy's fantasy takes over. She closes her eyes. \n\n\nEXT. FANTASY HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY Wink, younger and prettier, naps in an uncharacteristically colorful lawn chair. A LOW, GURGLING GROWL wakes him up. There in the yard, crawling slow and lazy, is a massive 15- foot alligator, breathing the heavy, slutty way alligators breathe\n\n\nA topless woman steps in front. Sweat beading on her perfect shoulder blades, down her perfect, back ending in a pair of boys' underpants- just like Hushpuppy's. Throughout Hushpuppy's vision, we never see Marietta's face, it's always covered, shot from the back, or out of frame. Marietta cocks the shotgun with one hand, Terminator 2 style. Lowers it on the gator... BLAM. Wink sits up in SLOW MOTION- her panties, and her long naked legs are covered with gator blood. She turns to Wink, her head ABOVE FRAME. CLOSE UP on her eye. She winks. \n\nINT. FANTASY HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - NIGHT We follow behind Marietta's supple curves as she walks into the kitchen. Her white slip is almost see through...almost. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Back when Daddy used to talk about Mamma, he'd say she was so pretty she never even had to turn on the stove. She runs her fingers along the counter and the burners IGNITE one by one as she passes. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) She just walk into a room and water start to boil. Water starts to bubbles like a spontaneous volcanic eruption. Marietta reaches into the frigidaire, and pulls out two ice- cold beers. Ice melts down the bottles. She opens them on the counter, flawlessly. She walks over to Wink. Stands there. A hot mess. Wink's voice FADES UP \n\nWINK (V.O.) Your Momma battered that gator up, and set it to fry. \n\n\nCUT TO: INT. LADY JO'S BAR - NIGHT Wink tips his drink.\n\n\nWINK: ...and Hushpuppy popped into the universe maybe four minutes later. He empties the glass, sufficiently drunk now.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) I got it under control. Wink looks away, lost in his own fantasy. INT. FANTASY HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - NIGHT Over Marietta's shoulder, beads of sweat form along the strap of her slip. Good Lord. Wink looks, and meets her eyes. The gaze of a proud and smitten man. Grits fall through the chimney vent, into the boiling water. Dancing like all the invisible particles of the universe. \n\n\nINT. LADY JO'S BAR - NIGHT Hushpuppy stares hard, her face locked in pride and determination. Filling with all the strength and heroism of her long-lost mother. She's ready to snap into action. \n\n\nEXT. FLOODED BATHTUB - THE TURCK - DAY ENERGETIC MUSIC drops and we move in a semi-montage through Hushpuppy's search for survivors. Hushpuppy rows the Turck through the flooded Bathtub by herself. In the distance she sees a lone horse. It stands on an tiny island of land, the last high ground in an endless stretch of water\n\n\nThe horse holds Hushpuppy's gaze. She hears it's strong, resilient HEARTBEAT. They are one and the same. \n\nEXT. SCHOOLBOAT - THE TURCK - DAY Hushpuppy approaches Schoolboat, which has weathered the storm relatively intact.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Miss Bathsheba!? INT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY Hushpuppy opens the door. We hear RUSTLING and WHISPERING inside school. It's three little girls left behind in the storm. JOY STRONG, a tall, wild-haired leader; LIZARD, a tiny thing in a giant man's tee shirt, and T-LOU, the muscle of this girl gang, looking very meek in her desperate condition. The girls are huddled against each other, terrified, hungry, and alone. \n\nEXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY Miss Bathsheba, shell-shocked but steadfast, steers the boat toward the bar, the four girls now safely in her care. From the inside we hear CAROUSING, TOASTING, and RAUCOUS CAJUN MUSIC. \n\n\nINT. LADY JO'S BAR - FLOODED - NIGHT Wink pours a mountain of crab and shrimp at a great communal table, assembled from many different tables.\n\n\nWINK: Come on lets go! Time to eat! Come on children, feed up time! He sends a feast sliding across the floor under the table, where Joy, T-Lou, and Lizard dig in. Wink has decorated the bar with all the waterlogged relics of the Bathtub\n\n\nThe room is a shrine of people's chairs, umbrellas, clothing. We're late in the game, and the party has descended into utter debauchery. Jean raises a glass.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: To the last of the food!\n\n\nWALRUS: To the last of the water!\n\n\nLITTLE JO: You ain't drinkin' no water. Miss Bathsheba pour shots and toasts.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Yea, tastes like more, alright! Hushpuppy struggles to peel her shrimps, sitting on top of the table. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) For the ones we'd never find, we make a funeral the Bathtub way, with no crying allowed. Drunken Wink is giving drunken Walrus a bath as he eats.\n\n\nWALRUS: When the water goes down, I'm gonna French kiss the dirt!\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Water's not goin' down man.\n\n\nWINK: Nah, that's my beautiful place under there.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Man you know they got plenty of salt coming into that water, everything beautiful is gone. Trees are gonna dies first, then the animals, then the fish.\n\n\nWINK: I got it under control\n\n\nHushpuppy picks up a crab. She tries to pound it open, tries yanking on a leg. She can't shell it.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: Come on Hushpuppy, come over here lemme show you how. Hushpuppy sits down next to Jean, a good pupil. \n\nJEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D) Here baby. You hold like this, then you turn it over like that. Hushpuppy follows instruction in deep concentration, but a bit tentative. We see Wink look away from Walrus and Jo's bawdy humor extravaganza and focus in on Hushpuppy. His disdain is palpable for this froufrou shelling technique. J\n\nEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D) Don't be scared of it now. Now, you take this knife, and you pop this off. Jean holds Hushpuppy's hand and guides a knife to open the belly of the crab. \n\nJEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D) Atta girl.\n\n\nWINK: NO! Hushpuppy-- Wink POUNDS the table. And the party falls suddenly silent. Wink pushes the utensil away. He grabs a crab, opens it in three virtuosic hand motions. Grease and spice explode everywhere and Wink sucks the face of the crab clean. It is beautiful to watch. He slams a fresh crab in front of Hushpuppy.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Beast it! Hushpuppy looks to Miss Bathsheba for guidance.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: You heard your Daddy. Beast it\n\n\nHushpuppy pulls on the crab shell with all her might. She doesn't have the power.\n\n\nEVERYONE: (CLAPPING ALONG) BEAST IT! BEAST IT! BEAST IT! The kids jump out from under the table and chant. Hushpuppy is turning blue, her eyes bulge with effort... CRACK! Hushpuppy opens the crab claw and sucks down the meat. Everyone goes wild with applause! The kids too! Hushpuppy stands up, ascending to the top of the table. She lets loose a WARRIOR CRY and flexes her muscles, deadly triumphant. Little Jo gets so excited she starts dancing on the table. She CACKLES and jitterbugs wildly. Walrus gets up to join her. Jean gets up and dances too. All the kids get up. Wink glows with pride. Miss Bathsheba smiles.\n\n\nWINK: Yea! You see what kinda family we got?! We got feeling! \n\n\nEXT. SCHOOLBOAT - FLOODED - VARIOUS A DRIVING SCORE kicks in as we MONTAGE through the transformation of the Schoolboat into a ramshackle Ark. \n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) It wasn't no time to sit around crying like a bunch of pussies. The survivors whittle sticks into spears, bend metal debris into spikes. \n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) We was gonna build a camp right on top of the Bathtub\n\n\nJean Battiste, cackling wildly, hauls a thrashing goat onto a floating animal pen. Chicken coops, snake cages, a pig pen are stacking precariously.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: We got enough animals to eat until the water goes down. Rafts are lashed to the sides of the school. Every floating structure left in town is hauled in and added to the Ark. Peter T ties on a floating vegetable garden. In WIDE we see what looks like a small village of floating structures forming. \n\n\nINT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY Miss Bathsheba puts Lizard's head in her lap, Lizard is playing as if she's unconscious after hyperventilating.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: (teaching a lesson) Come here, like this. She takes Hushpuppy's hand and places it on Lizard's chest. She moves her hand in a circular motion. \n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Like this. Tee-Lou get some water. Tee-Lou runs to get a handful of water. \n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Quick little circles. Good for the heart. Joy Strong? Joy turns her back. Miss Bathsheba shakes her head. Tee-Lou returns and pours water on Lizard's head, cooling her. \n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) This is most important thing I can ever teach y'all. You got to take care of people that's smaller and sweeter than you are. Hushpuppy registers this advice, takes it to heart. She rubs Lizard's chest with delicacy and affection Lizard's breathing returns to normal, and she sits up peacefully. Hushpuppy is awestruck. Bathsheba gets to her feet. \n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) That's better. \n\n\nINT. SCHOOLHOUSE - NIGHT Hushpuppy watches Wink sleeping. His breathing has gotten worse. She tiptoes up with her red basketball jersey and lays it down on Wink, tucking him in just right. A DISTANT RUMBLING is heard. Cutting off suddenly as we... \n\n\nCUT TO: EXT. BRAZILIAN FAVELLAS - DAY A quiet town, not unlike the Bathtub, but with tangled power- lines, electrical towers, and layered hills. A stone flies from behind a house and bounces down the street, denting the silence. Slowly, the peaceful morning transitions into MORE RUMBLING, a distant CRACK. Suddenly the house in the foreground explodes to smithereens and the head of an Aurochs drives through it. Without breaking step, Aurochs maraud the village, trampling it into oblivion. We settle close on an Aurochs eye, emotionless and relentless in its calm. \n\n\nEXT. BATHTUB MARSH WATER - TURCK - MORNING Wink, Hushpuppy, and the Bathtub crew pole the Turck through a lake blanketed with carcasses, pushing through the dead fish, dead porpoises, dead alligator garfish like they were lily pads. There is no wind, only dense wet heat searing on the faces of the characters. The once green foliage has gone brown and thirsty \n\nHUSHPUPPY V.O. Two weeks later, everything started to die.\n\n\nWINK: (to the water) Come on fishes, where y'at? Wink empties his net- nothing but a pile of carcasses. He tips it back into the water. Wink pulls himself to the edge and sticks his head under to look for fish. Hushpuppy looks at him with an air of doubt for the first time. Wink looks ridiculous, a dead fish drifts off his head.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (WHISPERING) You wanna leave the Bathtub, Walrus?\n\n\nWALRUS: (WITHOUT THOUGHT) Nah. Wink pulls his head back up.\n\n\nWINK: I heard that. Hushpuppy fidgets guiltily.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Nobody's leaving the Bathtub! You don't know nothing! Wink lowers his net back in the water.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) (TO WALRUS) This water gonna kill us here. We gotta do something `bout this. I ain't starvin' to death while them people go grocery shopping up there. \n\n\nINT. SCHOOLBOAT - FLOODED - MORNING The kids sleep on Miss Bathsheba in a big pile on the floor Hushpuppy wakes hearing SHIFTING and a SNAP behind her. Peter T is uncapping a shotgun shell and pouring black powder into a small jar. She looks out the window where Jean Battiste is unhooking a propane container from Miss Bathsheba's burner. He opens her chest freezer and hefts out a 12-foot garfish, dropping the container in the water.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: Shit! Wink sneaks up and whispers to Hushpuppy.\n\n\nWINK: Boss, Daddy's gotta take care of something. Hushpuppy is instantly concerned, she's heard this line before, and it always leads to trouble.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) I'm gonna fix everything back how it was.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Everything gonna go right back?\n\n\nWINK: Hell yeah, we gonna win. Wink pounds his chest in solidarity. Hushpuppy matches his pound, but without confidence.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Boss, anything go wrong, Walrus is Daddy. Wink and Hushpuppy look Walrus-- the face of doddering drunken bewilderment. A goat licks him. Hushpuppy is not comforted.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) You're gonna be the king of the Bathtub, I promise that. Wink can see he's getting nowhere\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Just sit here I'll be right back. The DOOR CLOSING wakes Miss Bathsheba up. She scans the room, noticing the three missing people.\n\n\nWALRUS: (an unconvincing lie) I think they be gone. I-I really can't say where.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Walrus, don't make me slap your ass! They go to the levee!? Walrus is intimidated into silence.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) You so much as piss on that wall, you know what them people gonna do? They gonna smoke us out and stick us in a damn shelter. Hushpuppy watches Miss Bathsheba go for her boat keys. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy says, brave men don't run from their home. Hushpuppy scurries out the side window, escaping outside before Miss Bathsheba sees her. \n\n\nEXT. UNDER THE TURCK TARP - DAY Wink, Jean Battiste, and Peter T keep their heads above water as they float under the tarp behind the truck bed. Peter T is wearing a life jacket and still has his top hat on.\n\n\nWINK: (WHISPERING) Peter T, don't hold onto me, hold onto the boat. You gonna be fine. Jean Battiste duct tapes fireworks around the bomb: a propane tank with an igniter made from a battery and a pouch of black powder. He inserts the bomb into the stomach cavity of a giant garfish carcass\n\n\nWink shoves two propane tanks inside the belly of the garfish. He hands a rope attached to the igniter to Peter T.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Peter T, you hold the trip-line.\n\n\nPETER T: (Soft and sweet) Ok then.\n\n\nWINK: Just don't pull `til I say.\n\n\nPETER T: Ok then.\n\n\nWINK: You can do it. I have complete faith in you.\n\n\nPETER T: Ok. Jean Battiste is hesitant. Wink gives Jean Battiste a confident nod.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: Lock and load. Jean Battiste carefully unravels the string that leads to the fuse. He shoves the igniter down the mouth of the garfish. \n\n\nEXT. LEVEE WALL, IN THE WATER - DAY The Turck pulls into an enclosed segment of the levee, Wink bobs out from under the Turck and latches a pre-made tether running out of the garfish to a handle on the wall. He bobs back under the boat. \n\n\nEXT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY Hushpuppy dives under the fishing net on a motor boat just before Miss Bathsheba charges outside and keys the ignition. Hushpuppy peeks out and the boat roars to life and rips across the water\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The entire universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If you can fix the broken piece, it can all go right back. \n\n\nINT. UNDER THE TURCK TARP/SANTA MARIA - DAY\n\n\nWINK: Peter T hand me the- He looks, Peter T has both hands on the Turck.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Peter you didn't drop the trip- line?\n\n\nPETER T: No I did not. Peter T thinks a moment. \n\nPETER T (CONT'D) Oh, yes I did.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: Oh, Peter T.\n\n\nPETER T: I'm sorry. Wink dunks under water. \n\n\nEXT. LEVEE - DAY Wink surfaces in front of the igniter rope. As he grabs the rope, Bathsheba's snake catcher snares his hand and pulls his arm against the side of her Jon boat.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Here's how we do with wild animals.\n\n\nWINK: AHH! Get off me woman! I'm trying to save the Bathtub Hushpuppy watches the struggle in hiding\n\n\nBathsheba wrenches the rope out of Wink's hand and chucks it. The igniter rope lands in front of Hushpuppy under the net pile. She grabs it. She reels it in.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Get in the Boat! I'm hauling you're ass back home, little boy. Jean Battiste swims out of hiding.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: Wink!?\n\n\nWINK: Jean Battiste, get the trip line! Suddenly, Hushpuppy pops out from under the nets, holding the rope taught. She stumbles and almost sets if off by accident.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Hushpuppy!?\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: She got it! Pull! Pull!\n\n\nWINK: NOW BOSS!\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: No! Hushpuppy! Hushpuppy, contemplates in an eerie peace. The screaming chorus FADES and she is alone in her quiet, eyes darting between Bathsheba and Wink. Courage and certainly clench inside her her. You listen to your Daddy. She pulls the rope. \n\n\nEXT. LEVEE WALL IN THE WATER - DAY The trip-line releases the detonator. \n\n\nEXT. LEVEE - NORTH SIDE - DAY The levee DETONATES. Shattered wood and cement fire towards camera\n\n\nDebris propels Hushpuppy backwards. Her quiet resumes as she lands on the deck of the boat in slow motion. She watches in a daze as smoke, water, and flaming dust cycles above her. All the beauty of the universe. \n\n\nEXT. FLOODPLAIN - THE BATHTUB - DAY Water recedes in the Bathtub, revealing the tragic, mud- soaked remnants of their paradise. Hushpuppy slogs through the muck, each step going two feet down into the stinking filth. The crew trudges behind her in silence. EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY The blow-up crew crests a hill and sees the remains of the ark sprawled across an open field. Wink's and Hushpuppy's eyes well up as they beholds the state of their island. The water has drained. Everything is dead. More striking than the ripped-up houses, the land surrounding the island has disappeared. Trees are gone. Shards of marsh that had been attached float in the distance. What was a dense, green landscape is barren. The Bathtub is a scorched hell.\n\n\n EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST-FLOOD - EVENING Hushpuppy picks through the rubble of the Shacko in the Backo. She finds their grill, and a window made from a dryer door and brings them to Wink. The Shacko has crash landed under the stilts of a house that's been entirely washed away. Wink has done some work reassembling the walls and broken parts into a semi- functional enclosure. \n \n \n EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST-FLOOD - LATER THAT NIGHT Hushpuppy find nails and brings them to Wink, who leans wall panels against the stilts from the previous house He hammers nails wearily. His strength is sapped. He HACKS out bile. \n \n \n HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) It didn't matter that the water was gone. Sometimes, you can break something so bad, that it can't get put back together. \n \n \n INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - EVENING Hushpuppy climbs the stairs of the original house to get to the top of the Shacko. She looks down through the hole in the floor. In her POV Wink climbs into bed, he painfully takes his shirt off. The bruise on his chest has extended all the way across his stomach. Hushpuppy looks out on the water for some sign that Marietta's still with her. The light shining on the water is off. She sees nothing but dead trees and a defunct oil rig.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Mamma!? Nothing.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) Mamma where you at!? As if in response, we hear a HELICOPTER LOUDSPEAKER.\n\n\nPILOT: This is a mandatory evacuation area, you can no longer live here. Everyone in this area, has to leave. I repeat.... \n\n\nEXT. DEAD FOREST - MORNING Hushpuppy wades through the muck in what used to be a lush forest, now reduced to toothpick trees and mud. She finds her storage unit in the tree hollow, and lifts out the medicine jar\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When you're small, you gotta fix what you can. \n\n\nINT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - NIGHT She pours the crushed up roots into Wink's mouth, careful not to disturb him. Wink dooesn't move. Hushpuppy gently folds in the orange fungus. Quiet, quiet--\n\n\nWINK: GUUAAAHH! Wink spews up an explosive cloud of medicine.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) God damn! Wink grabs her medicine jar and threatens her with it.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) What you doing!? He smashes it against the wall.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) What the hell's wrong with you! Hushpuppy is so upset she doesn't know what to do. She screams in anger.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Raaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! Raging, Hushpuppy breaks everything she can get her hands on, ruining everything Wink's reassembled, tipping shelves, pans, walls. She grabs a fishing pole and starts bashing Wink's grill over and over.\n\n\nWINK: You wanna throw things? Come on! I can do that too. You want to play that game? Let's throw stuff! Wink joins in, breaking stuff too, channeling all his anger into the destruction. Wink throws himself into the wall. It breaks off and dumps a series of shelves all over the floor\n\n\nHushpuppy can't believe it. Suddenly it's cathartic, they start throwing objects at each other and laughing.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Come on! Come on! Wink pegs her in the face with a stuffed animal and she grins. Hushpuppy throws a pillow!\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) AAAAH!!! COME ON! COME ON! Hushpuppy throws a shoe.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) AAAAAHHHHH!!!!! YEAH!! COME ON! Hushpuppy and Wink destroy everything in the house. Something goes off in Wink chest. He grabs his heart and collapses on the floor. Hushpuppy realizes something's not right. She throws a life- jacket at her father. Wink continues to force a smile at her. Hushpuppy won't return the smile.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Man. You think I don't know. Hushpuppy's bottom lip starts quivering. Wink's smiles disappears.\n\n\nWINK: Hey. No crying. Don't you cry man. Don't you cry! He threatens her with a shoe. Hushpuppy hides behind an overturned chest.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) HEY! Don't cry damn it! Wink hangs his head and catches his breath against the wall\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Shit. He pull himself to his feet and grabs a bottle of moonshine. He sets up two cups on the table.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Come on get a drink. Wink pours Hushpuppy a shot. Hushpuppy sips. Winces. Looks suspiciously at her father. Sips again. Wink takes one straight from the bottle.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) This counts as I'm sorry for a whole buncha things. Lord.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: You gonna be gone?\n\n\nWINK: What? No!\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: You gonna leave me alone?\n\n\nWINK: I ain't gon' leave nothing.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Cause if you be gone, I be gone too.\n\n\nWINK: Hushpuppy, that is not how it works.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I will. Sometimes in the bed I start shaking and can't stop. I got what you got.\n\n\nWINK: No man. That's just a side effect of being a stupid little girl\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I ain't gonna be dead?\n\n\nWINK: No. You? No! You gonna live a hundred years more. You know what, show me the guns. Hushpuppy shoves Wink.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Show me them guns man. Wink clears everything off the table with one sweep.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Show me the guns! Guns! guns! guns! guns! guns! Hushpuppy flexes her biceps. She begins to chant, fierce and\n\n\nTRIUMPHANT--: HUSHPUPPY\n\n\nGuns! Guns! Guns! Guns!.....\n\n\nWINK: (OVERLAPPING) Guns man, give to me! Guns! Guns! Wink holds up his hand to arm-wrestle. They SCREAM in tandem as Hushpuppy pins him hard.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Ooooo, Hushpuppy you the man. Who the man?\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I'm the man.\n\n\nWINK: Who the man!?\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I'm the man!\n\n\nWINK: TELL ME LOUDER WHO THE MAN!!!!\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I'm THE MAN!!!!!!! 52\n\n\nWINK: YOU THE MAN, RIGHT?! Wink is overcome with love. It's too much for him to bear.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Fuck this table! In a violent euphoria, Wink grabs the table and hurls it across the room. This scares Hushpuppy. She stares silently at her wild animal father, longing for something more than rage. Wink takes a step toward like he's going to comfort her, then stops, turning back.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) I gotta lay down hear? I gotta be strong. Don't be scared. Wink lays down in the corner. Hushpuppy doesn't go to bed, she just stands there.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) What? Hushpuppy waits, not backing down.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) (GIVING IN) Come here. Hushpuppy goes to Wink.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Lay down. Wink pats his heart for her to put her head down on it. A long beat.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Hey.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Yea?\n\n\nWINK: You ain't the one who's sick\n\n\nShe listens to his BIG HUGE HEART. EXT. WET SAND MUCK EXPANSE - DAY The Aurochs move into a desolate, barren, wasteland, looking exhausted and starved. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Strong animals got no mercy. Cold wind blows them backwards. An old Aurochs falls behind the pack. Its legs give out and it lays down. It's not going to make it. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They the type of animals that eats their own Mommas and Daddies. \n\n\nCUT TO: The Aurochs cannibalize their fallen comrade, ripping skin and organs in a storm of flesh and gore. The CRIES of the screaming mother melt together with another, sound, more MECHANICAL... INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - MORNING The SOUND becomes recognizable as a HELICOPTER PROPELLER. Hushpuppy opens her eyes, still tucked in Wink's arm. Through the wall she sees FOUR WELL-DRESSED men. They are out of place like aliens exiting their space ship. She rouses Wink, he hears the FOREIGN SOUNDING VOICES and yanks Hushpuppy up. He instinctively pulls him and Hushpuppy behind the over-turned table and grabs a broken chair leg to defend them with. EVACUATOR (O.S.) (from outside the door) This is a mandatory evacuation area. Everyone in this region has to leave. Wink hurls the chair leg at the intruders as they try to enter\n\n\nWINK: We ain't going nowhere! Hushpuppy grabs a chair leg as well. It's a standoff. INT. LADY JO'S HOUSE - POST FLOOD - MORNING Three evacuation workers ram the door of Little Jo's house. Little Jo greets the intruders brandishing a cutting knife and civil war era pistol.\n\n\nLITTLE JO: You gonna have to shoot me cause I'm not going.\n\n\nEVACUATOR 2: Ma'am we're not gonna shoot you.\n\n\nLITTLE JO: I ain't never left here and I won't never will. She spits. They get closer. LITTLE JO (CONT'D) Son, don't make me cancel your birth certificate. The Muscle grabs her by the weapons and in the struggle, slam her to the ground. It's horrible.\n\n\nEVACUATOR 2: Relax, relax ma'am.\n\n\nLITTLE JO: YOU SON OF A BITCH! They drag Little Jo out of the house. INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - MORNING MATCH CUT to Wink and Hushpuppy pinned and being dragged out.\n\n\nWINK: Get your hands off of her! I'm gonna kill you! Let her go! 55\n\n\nEXT. REFUGEE CAMP - DAY CRASH CUT TO an off-white monolithic community center surrounded by a cement parking lot. Stressed, amateur looking doctors from the real world move in and out of the glass doors. A makeshift sign reads \"Open Arms Processing Center.\" INT. REFUGEE CAMP - COTS - DAY The interior of the refugee camp is violently, fluorescent- lit and painted white in an attempt to maintain a facade of sterility. Hushpuppy stares at the strange and modern ceiling like they've descended from another planet. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) It didn't look like a prison, it looked like a fish tank with no water. The Bathtub residents walk through the gymnasium which has been converted into a holding tank/hospital for refugees. Student doctors are examining, treating, feeding people. The abandoned souls, the sick, and the old are lined up waiting for assistance. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - KITCHEN - DAY A processed egg patty jiggles weirdly as it hits Hushpuppy's tray.\n\n\nWINK: Don't eat that. DR. MALONEY, a clean-cut, over-extended handsome young doctor hustles toward the lunch line. DR. MALONEY Mr. Doucet, can I have a word with you, we found something in your test. It's-\n\n\nWINK: Whoa whoa whoa, not in front of my kid. Stay, Hushpuppy\n\n\nWink pulls Maloney out of earshot. DR. MALONEY Mr. Doucet, there's no easy way to say this... Hushpuppy struggles to hear more, only a couple words come through the din of refugees. DR. MALONEY (CONT'D) ...require surgery immediately...you need to think about what you want for your daughter...you could die. In Hushpuppy's POV: Maloney puts a sympathetic hand on Wink's shoulder and Wink pushes it off violently. Maloney puts up his hands in peace and Wink shoves him through one of the curtains and is assaulted by a flood of orderlies.\n\n\nWINK: I don't need nothing from you! You keep your hands off her! I don't need nothing from y'all! Let me go! Hushpuppy is snatched as she fights to come to his rescue.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Daddy! They tackle Wink to the ground. He goes limp as he falls. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - COTS - DAY We TRACK with Wink as he comes to consciousness rolling through the cots. He is sedated and being pushed in a wheelchair. He looks through an open door. In Wink's POV- Joy, Tee-Lou, Lizard, and the rest of Bathsheba's original school class play in a room with a BABYSITTER. She tickles Hushpuppy, who has been given new clothes and looks like a normal little girl for the first time. Her boots and boys underpants have been traded for a delicate blue dress. The image is jarring\n\n\nBABYSITTER: Hushpuppy needs a hug.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I don't want your hug! The Babysitter squeezes Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy tries to squirm away.\n\n\nBABYSITTER: Hushpuppy, that's not how nice girls act. Say \"I'm sorry ma'am.\" Hey! Say it. Say it or you're going to corner time. Hushpuppy's eyes meet Wink's and she freezes at his horrifying appearance. Wink grabs a sofa trying to stop the wheelchair as it rolls by. His fingers slips off, too weak to hold on. He tries to scream and nothing but a SEDATED MOAN comes out of his mouth. He tries to pull the tubes out of his arm.\n\n\nORDERLY: (gently moving Wink's hand AWAY)\n\n\nThere there, sir. Hushpuppy stares in shock as Wink is wheeled away. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - WINK'S ROOM - NIGHT Hushpuppy watches in hiding as a hand covered in a rubber glove changes the bandage on a surgical scar; it looks infected and mishandled. The same hand puts pills in Wink's mouth. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - TERMINAL WARD - DAY Hushpuppy stands over an old man on an artificial respirator. She's creeps closer, examining him. She puts her head on his chest. His heart is beating. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When an animal gets sick here, they plug it into the wall. She whispers in his ear\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: They're coming for you. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - TERMINAL WARD - A DIFFERENT BED - DAY She repeats the process with another vegetable. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy says, if he ever got so old he couldn't drink beer, or catch catfish, that I had to put him in a boat, and set him on fire, so no one could come plug him into the wall. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - WINK'S ROOM - NIGHT Hushpuppy peeks through the curtains at another terminal bed. She sees two orderlies force pills into Wink's mouth. He's regaining his strength and is able to hold them off momentarily before submitting, and going limp. Hushpuppy bolts, unable to take it. We stay in the room as the orderlies walk away. Wink peeks to make sure they're gone, then spits his pills on the floor. Wink stares at the ceiling for a long beat. Then, with a burst of energy he grabs his morphine drip and topples himself onto the floor. He pulls his wires out. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - KID'S ROOM - MORNING Hushpuppy lies asleep in a pile with Tee-Lou, Lizard, and Joy. Wink enters and jostles her awake.\n\n\nWINK: Boss. Let's go.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Where we goin'? 59\n\n\nINT. REFUGEE CAMP - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Wink and the girls hustle to the entrance of the Refugee center. Walrus comes running down the hall, pushing Peter T on a gurney. Wink looks bewildered, the rest of the team seems to have their own plan afoot. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - COTS - MORNING Jean Battiste and Little Jo charge through the cots riling refugees into revolt as the orderlies chase them trying to maintain decorum.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: Go home! Everybody get up! Don't you want to go home? Lets go! These people don't care about you! Little Jo fights off an orderly with a syringe.\n\n\nLITTLE JO: You live in this hell hole! INT/EXT. REFUGEE CAMP - EVACUATION BUS - DAY Wink runs the kids toward the bus, they pass two busses labeled for Salt Lake City, Des Moines. Wink helps Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard get on. Then Hushpuppy. Suddenly Wink's hand slips out of Hushpuppy's. He steps away from the evacuating bus. Hushpuppy turns and the bus door slams between them.\n\n\nWINK: (from outside the door) Make sure you put her somewhere good ok? Wink sags. He's giving her away. He turns to leave..\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (banging on the door) NO! I ain't running! No! 60\n\n\nWink walks away from the bus, his chest heaving, his face clutched in the horror of what he's done. Behind him, the bus pulls forward, then veers violently. Hushpuppy charges the driver clawing at her face, punching and kicking.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) Let me go! The driver pulls the break and Hushpuppy bangs the doors open. She charges Wink from behind, gives him a diving shove. He topples over.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) You trying to get rid of me! You trying to get rid of me!\n\n\nWINK: No!\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Why you trying to get rid of me?\n\n\nWINK: I ain't trying to get rid of you.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: You is.\n\n\nWINK: No. Hushpuppy... I can't take care of you no more.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Yes you can. Hushpuppy stares him down, accusing.\n\n\nWINK: Daddy's dying! Hushpuppy's chest heaves up and down.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) My blood is eating itself. You know what that means? 61\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Don't be sayin' about dying.\n\n\nWINK: Everybody's Daddy dies.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Not my Daddy.\n\n\nWINK: Yes, your Daddy! Her defiance is broken and the information starts to sink in. It hurts Wink as much as it hurts her.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) I didn't want you to watch that, ok? You understand? Wink doubles over hacking. He COUGHS horribly. Hushpuppy looks down and sees blood spotting the grass, dripping from his mouth. The Bathtub gangs charges out the door! Across the parking lot they go in a spree of euphoria, coming to a halt around Wink. Hushpuppy is trying to drag his limp body across the parking lot.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Come on! Come on! Little Jo hold Hushpuppy away from him.\n\n\nWINK: Walrus, get me home. EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY The Bathtub crew carries Wink through the entrance to town. His arms slug over Walrus and Jean Battiste, he's barely able to help walk. We sense from the weary faces and silent eyes that it's been a long journey home\n\n\nINT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY They drag Wink through the Shacko entrance. Everyone goes in except Hushpuppy who stops outside the door as they lay him down in convulsions. She stays and tries to watch. Wink tries to say something to Walrus and can't. Blood bubbles out of his mouth. Wink catches Hushpuppy's eye then looks away as fast as he can. Reeling, but steady, Hushpuppy backs out the door. EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY Hushpuppy walks down the road in an almost eerie state of calm. She takes in the remnants of rusting houses and flipped boats, her lifeless ghost town. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Everybody looses the thing that made them, it's even how it's supposed to be in nature. EXT. LAVA RIDGE - DAY Now with her three friends, she tip-toes past several humongous footprints up to a gruesome fox carcass. Something gigantic has ripped open its stomach and gutted it. She leans over, unafraid, trying to understand it's meaning. Flies swarm and nibble, their movement almost elegant. Seen in close up, the gory mess has a strange beauty to it. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The brave men stay and watch it happen. They don't run. A SONIC BOOM springs her upright, she looks around for the source of the sound. Is it an Aurochs? She looks towards the muddy bayou. The SONIC BOOM sounds again and the entire body of water quivers with the impact. EXT. DARDAR RIDGE - EVENING The beacon blinks out on the water Hushpuppy stares towards it. The children are gathered behind her. Something has changed in her eyes. The eerie calm has given way to a hardened determination. Though unclear to us, her internal path of action is certain. She takes a deep breath, and lets out a WARRIOR CRY. She runs straight into the water with her girl gang charging behind her. EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - EVENING Joy, Tee-Lou, Lizard, and Hushpuppy swim through open water, pulling each other forward. They head in the direction of the beacon.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Come on! Keep going! They try to kick toward the light but are getting nowhere, the current pulls them backwards. We hear a BOAT HORN and they look to where an ANCIENT TUG BOAT with a cabin that towers into the sky like a giraffe head, appears through the mist. EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - SERGEANT MAJOR'S BOAT - EVENING The girls climb aboard, lifting each other onto the deck. They look up to the sound of FOOTSTEPS on the upper deck. Hushpuppy looks up to see SERGEANT MAJOR  - A big, timeless looking man with a salt and pepper moustache, saunters up to the rail. He stares down, examining these runts with an air of suspicion.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I'm going by my Mamma. He smiles broadly, as if this was the secret password. Him and Hushpuppy stare at each other and immediately there is understanding. Two lost souls in the wilderness.\n\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: That's a good place to go\n\n\nEXT. GULF OF MEXICO - SERGEANT MAJOR'S BOAT - EVENING Hushpuppy sits adjacent to the Sergeant in the tug's elevated wheelhouse. They are two stories up, and the white walls create a glow that makes us feel like we're almost in another dimension.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Which way are we going?\n\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Don't matter baby, this boat'll take you exactly where you need to be. It's just that type of boat. Hushpuppy and Sergeant Major share an ease unlike anyone else we've seen Hushpuppy interacted with. The speak like an old teacher with his favorite disciple. They let their silences last. SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D) You want a chicken biscuit? Hushpuppy shakes her head `no'. SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D) They're good for you. A deep, far away melancholy settles over him. He munches on a chicken biscuit, then tosses the wrapper on the floor. The wheelhouse is wall to wall with chicken biscuit wrappers. SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D) I been eating these all my life. I keep the wrappers in the boat, `cause they remind me who I was when I ate each one. The smell make me feel cohesive.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I wanna be cohesive.\n\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Oh you will be, I got no doubt in my mind. They let this thought settle, then Hushpuppy turns her swivel chair back toward the water 65\n\n\nThe beacon appears through the mist. Hushpuppy's eyes go wide. As they approach, another boat comes into view. A half- sunken barge that looks as though its been rusting in the same position for a century. As we move in we see a lit up sign: \"Elysian Fields Floating Catfish Shack GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS.\" EXT./INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - ENTRANCE - EVENING Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard disembark onto the barge with Sergeant Major following behind. They circle around a hatch in the floor with light pulsing out of it. Far-away JAZZ echoes up from the bowels of the ship. They look to each other in wonder. INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT Hushpuppy descends a ladder into a glimmering wonderland. Christmas lights swallow the ceiling, and a light smoke facade encompasses everything. We feel like we're looking at a portal into the past, a Belloq-esque turned New Orleans Jazz parlor. The regulars are all oil-workers wooing their ladies of the night. There is a stage with a DJ and two singers, karaokeing along with \"Until the Real Thing Comes Along\" by Fats Waller. The hyperactive MISS FRANKIE, the matriarch of this establishment, comes a'hoppin'.\n\n\nMISS FRANKIE: Holy crap you have toddlers!\n\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Good afternoon, Miss Frankie.\n\n\nMISS FRANKIE: Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit! How you, Sergeant Major? You need some grits?\n\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Yes ma'am\n\n\nMISS FRANKIE: Holy Sugar, they are so precious! Y'all just as cute as a tub of puppies! Women descend on the kids who recoil, not knowing what to do with all this affection. Joy Strong puts up her fists. Hushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry of doting ladies. They are not who she is looking for. They are not who she is looking for. She scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up all over the ceiling, each of them with a bra hung on it, none of them right. Bar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes, ladies smile and return to their drinks, drunk flirtatious dancers giggle at her, but she remains unfazed. She reaches two swinging doors that lead to the kitchen. Hushpuppy stops. Sniffs. Heaven. SLOW MOTION: in Hushpuppy's POV, smoke curls through the swinging doors, the light illuminating the dust particles. It's a magic kitchen. Her POV tilts down to the floor where a pair of well-pedicured feet in flip-flops walks towards the swinging doors. They open. Hushpuppy holds her breath. A gorgeous COOK  wearing a baseball cap and an apron comes out the double doors. She wipes some sweat off her brow. She watches the band and kills a bottle of ice-cold beer. The Cook looks down. Sees Hushpuppy.\n\n\nCOOK: You need something baby? Hushpuppy nods, holding her breath. She still can't speak.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) Well whatchu want? You alone? Hushpuppy shrugs. She's too stunned, too shy to speak\n\n\nThe Cook takes stock of the helpless creature in front of her. Like a butcher shop owner with a pesky hungry puppy, she submits to Hushpuppy's longing gaze.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) Get in here, I'm'll show you a magic trick. Hushpuppy follows her into the magic kitchen, knocking her head against the swinging doors on her way in. INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - KITCHEN With the smooth fanfare of a circus performer, The Cook lifts an egg, opens a beer bottle with her teeth, SPITS the cap at the egg and it cracks over the grits. Hushpuppy's face is joy beyond all measure. She watches the Cook's flying hands, she prepares everything in a single motion, it's like a dance. She slaps a fresh alligator tail on the table and begins sawing through the scales.\n\n\nCOOK: Lemme tell you somethin', when you're a child people tell you that everything's gonna be all hunky- dory and all that bullshit, but I'm here to tell you that it's not. So get that out your head right now. She removes the knife from the gator and aims it at Hushpuppy like its a pointer.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) Life's some big old feast, yeah, but you? You ain't nothin' but a stupid little waitress. She scales a gator, strips the bones, dredges, fries.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) Everything you got on your platter gonna fall on the floor and ain't nobody gonna be there to pick it up for you. Someday it's all gonna be on you\n\n\nShe stirs the grits. Grits on plate. Gator on plate. Plate in front of Hushpuppy. Lemon is squeezed all over everything.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) So smile, girl. Hushpuppy tries to crack a grin. She barely remembers how to smile and it comes out all wrong. The Cook shakes her head, opens another beer on her teeth, and heads for the pantry.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) Nobody likes a pity-party-having- ass-woman. Hushpuppy stays behind staring into the floating particles of dust in the incandescent light-- stars of the universe. The golden bubbling fry pot-- lava of the molten core. INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT Four perfect gator nuggets are placed next to a sumptuous dollop of grits.\n\n\nCOOK: The gator's magic. Hushpuppy looks up from her food-hypnosis.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) (encouraging a smile) Awwwwwwwww. A real smile emerges across Hushpuppy's face.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) Mmm-hmm. INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT Magic soars as the couples rock back and forth on the dance floor. Strippers cradle their dates. It's all very sweet and tender. This seems to be the M.O of this strip club, slow-dance not pole-dance. The kids are each dancing with a stripper, glowing with love. They are orphans in a heaven of mothers\n\n\nWe float back to Hushpuppy, the camera dances with her and the Cook. The Cook squeezes Hushpuppy and spins her. Each time we catch their face their eyes are wetter and wetter.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: You can take care of me. Me and Daddy. After a long beat. The Cook shakes her head `no.'\n\n\nCOOK: I don't know nothing bout your Daddy, I can't take care of nobody but myself. This sinks into Hushpuppy.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) You can stay if you want. Hushpuppy considers this for a moment, squeezes the Cook.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: This is my favorite thing.\n\n\nCOOK: I know. A far-away look has come over her. Her mind is somewhere else. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) I can count all the time I've been lifted. INT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY We look up at a face that's slowly coming into focus- it's Wink, younger and healthier. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) I can count all the times I've been lifted on two fingers\n\n\nHe is the first sight of the slimy newborn baby girl tucked in his arm. Baby Hushpuppy stares up at him as he carries her. WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S) Wink! Bring my baby here! They need to wash her off.\n\n\nWINK: Naw, that waits. Baby Hushpuppy's huge-eyed, warped facial expression ogles Wink. She coos.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) (TO HUSHPUPPY) Alright fatso, breathe some air. They pass through a doorway and sun washes over Baby Hushpuppy. She smiles and smiles at the world. INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCEFLOOR - NIGHT Back in reality Hushpuppy gathers herself. She's suddenly not hugging back, just being held.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I need to go home.\n\n\nCOOK: (WHISPERED) No. Hushpuppy cups her hand to the Cook's ear and whispers something inaudible. The Cook squeezes her tight, seeming on the verge of adopting her. But she can't. She spins Hushpuppy around and around, then puts her down withouth meeting her gaze. Hushpuppy watches her disappear into the crowd of swaying couples. All goes quiet, and we sit behind Hushpuppy's head, a sea of light like a crown around her. MUSIC SWELLS. Decisively, with the force of a charging general, Hushpuppy turns and runs toward camera\n\n\nEXT. DEAD OAK RIDGE - DAY MATCH CUT to Hushpuppy leading Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard across a ridge dotted with Dead Oak trees, she's come back to the Bathtub. EXT. DEAD OAK RIDGE - WATER - DAY The camera moves over the water, past the dead oaks. We turn the corner past a stretch of marsh, and come upon the Aurochs, four of them, now suddenly and viscerally in the landscape of the Bathtub, swimming steadily toward solid land. INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY The Bathtub crew sits by Wink's bed. His eyes are open, but everyone is silently waiting for the inevitable. EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY The children crest the ridge. The RUMBLE of Aurochs hoofs is suddenly and violently audible. Hushpuppy turns. She catches a glimpses of something massive moving behind the distant oaks. The kids turn and hustle down the ridge. Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard hustle down hill with increased urgency. The DISTANT TRAMPLING is growing louder. Behind Hushpuppy the dark shapes of the Aurochs crest the ridge in a deafening STAMPEDE. Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard scream and sprint out in front of Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy walks steadily forward, refusing to run. Her face locked with determination, she is unafraid. Her eyes shoot toward the shacko. EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY Wink, with all his strength looks toward Hushpuppy, their eyes meet In Wink's POV, Hushpuppy stops dead on the bridge, waiting for her fate, staring toward her father. EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY The Aurochs bear down on Hushpuppy from behind, their footsteps rattling the frame. They grow inconceivably large, the camera has to tilt to hold the frame. Hushpuppy balls her fists and stands her ground. Suddenly, she turns. The Aurochs ROARS. Then, inches away from Hushpuppy, she stops. She SNORTS, blowing Hushpuppy's hair back. Hushpuppy doesn't flinch. The Aurochs stares face to face with Hushpuppy. Sniffs. EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY Wink is frozen in wonder, unable to believe his eyes. EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY Hushpuppy raises her chin in confident defiance. Now in full profile, we see the Aurochs towering 15-feet tall, she takes a step forwards, sniffs again. A low SNORT, or is it a purr? The Aurochs lowers her head with respect. Her eyes well with emotion, recognizing one of her own. A ferocious warrior. The Aurochs steps back, takes a knee, and with a BELLY FLOP that rattles the very earth, she lays down. Her three companions follow suit, their fat tummies settling into an almost joyful, lazy, repass. A strange calm has settled over Hushpuppy. Almost a smile, but more of a peace and an affection for her equal. They're both children in their way.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: You're my friend, kind of\n\n\nMother Aurochs grunts, a sentence only Hushpuppy can understand.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) I gotta take care of mine. With weary and clumsy steps, the Aurochs stand and retreat. EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY Hushpuppy approaches the shacko. It's like walking the plank, but she's unafraid, at one with her destiny. The Bathtub crew look on her in awe. They part ways to let her pass. She reaches the door, steeling her reserve. Hushpuppy opens the door. INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY Wink is curled up on Hushpuppy's bed-- very, very thin. His eyes are closed. His chest heaves up and down in short violent breaths. Hushpuppy stands and stares. Wink looks at Hushpuppy in reverence. He knows it's the last time. Wink motions for her to come closer. Hushpuppy inches toward him. It takes all of her might. She sits on his bed. Hushpuppy takes her to-go container from Elysian Fields out of a paper bag and pops it. She unwraps a gator nugget, dips it in hot sauce, and holds it out for Wink to take a bite. Hushpuppy watches as Wink chews weakly. She eats one herself. Wink and Hushpuppy draw it out. They don't want it to end. It takes a full minute for him to swallow the first bite, and she paces herself to finish when he does.\n\n\nWINK: (BARELY AUDIBLE) Real good\n\n\nWink's chest heaves up and down, harder and harder. A tear rolls down his face.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) (CHOKING UP) No crying, you hear? She holds them back, being tough for her Daddy.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: No crying. Hushpuppy's face hardens, and even as the tears fall, we see a strength and composure that only Wink could have put there. She falls into his arms and he embraces her. Hushpuppy squeezes Wink. She does not let go. She stays strong. Wink's hand trembles on her back. She holds him as his deep, warm, heartbeat slows, slows, and stops. His weight slumps over her. She keeps on holding him, but she knows. EXT. GRAVEYARD BY THE WATER - DAY Steadfast, Hushpuppy holds a torch on the edge of the Bathtub. The Turck, piled with branches, floats in front of her. She lowers the flame and lights a cloth covering Wink's body aflame. She pushes the funeral pyre out into the current. We watch the boat flames drift into the foreground, covering Hushpuppy face with flames. She looks into them in all her grief and wisdom. The group begins a funeral prayer, playing quiet in the background as Hushpuppy contemplates the pyre.\n\n\nPETER T: As I stand by the bayou, Everyone else joins him.\n\n\nEVERYONE: A ship at my side starts her motors and sails for the gulf. I watch her until she disappears. \"There! (MORE) 75\n\n\nEVERYONE: (CONT'D) She's gone!\" Gone where? Gone from my eyes, that's all. She's just as big as when she left me. And somewhere else, other voices are calling out, \"Here she comes!\" And that is dying. They raise their drinks to the sky and shout in unison.\n\n\nEVERYONE: (CONT'D) HERE! SHE! COMES! Hushpuppy gazes into the sparks leaping off the top of the fire are foregrounded in front of Hushpuppy, particles of Wink jumping into the sky. HORNS ENTER, droning low, and building into an funeral dirge. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When I relax behind my eyes I see everything that made me flying around in invisible pieces. When I look too hard it goes away, but when it all goes quiet, I see they are right here. The Turck almost disappears over the horizon. The HORNS take a hopeful turn, the melancholy of the dirge mixing with the anthem of the Bathtub. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) I see that I'm a little piece of a big, big universe, and that makes things right. Hushpuppy stands tiny on the ledge of the Earth, framed in front of an expanse of endless water. EXT. CAUSEWAY - POST-FLOOD - DAY The Bathtub gang marches across the marsh road. Hands touch the town sign, saying goodbye. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When I die, the scientists of the future, they gonna find it all. They gonna know, once there was a Hushpuppy, and she lived with her Daddy in the Bathtub\n\n\nCasino - Draft\n\n\nCASINO: By\n\n\nNicholas Pileggi EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS, 1983 - DAY SAM 'ACE' ROTHSTEIN, a tall, lean, immaculately dressed man approaches his car, opens the door, and gets inside to turn on the ignition.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.  Otherwise, what's the point? And, for a while... I believed that's the kind of love I had.\n\n\nSuddenly, the car explodes. Flames, smoke and metal rise into the sky covering the view of the Las Vegas casinos and their signs. Music in: J.S. Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'. Ace's body comes flying in - extreme slow motion. His body twists and turns through the frame like a soul about to tumble into the flames of damnation. MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE. \n\nINT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT Vignette of ACE through rippling flames, we move in on ACE ROTHSTEIN overseeing the casino. He lights a cigarette.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Before I ever ran a casino or got myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper, I can tell you that. I was so good, that whenever I bet, I could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country. I'm serious. I had it down so cold that I was given paradise on earth. I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...\n\n\nINT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT Vignette of MOB BOSSES sitting at a table surrounded by food and wine like the gods of Olympus.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Matter of fact...\n\n\nINT. BAR, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT Vignette of NICKY SANTORO standing at a bar with DOMINICK SANTORO, his brother, and FRANK MARINO, his right-hand man.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...nobody knew all the details, but it should'a been perfect. I mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass...\n\n\nINT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT Vignette of GINGER MCKENNA a dazzling thirty-one-year-old blonde seated by a small fiery pool.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...and he had Ginger, the woman he loved, on his arm.  But in the end...\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK/ACE'S OFFICE - NIGHT ACE looks over the casino he rules.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...we fucked it all up. It should'a been so sweet, too.  But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us were ever given anything that fuckin' valuable again.\n\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT Aerial shot coming down out of the clouds over the brightly lit Vegas Strip and off into the blackness of the desert night.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) At that time, Vegas was a place where millions of suckers flew in every year on their own nickel, and left behind about a billion dollars. But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas...\n\n\nEXT. DESERT - DAWN Aerial shot swooping along the desert floor, then rising above the mist to reveal mountains in the distance.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.\n\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP, 1973 - NIGHT TITLE IN: 'THE STRIP', 'LAS VEGAS', 'TEN YEARS EARLIER' ACE is greeted by a casino exec and walked through the brightly lit entrance to the Tangiers Casino.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Who could resist? Anywhere else in the country, I was a bookie, a gambler, always lookin' over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night. But here, I'm 'Mr Sam Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino. And that's like selling dreams for cash.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT We see ACE enter alone. He is greeted by BILLY SHERBERT. They are joined by top executives RICHIE and RONNIE in suits and ties. They walk through the casino, past crowded and noisy craps tables, spinning roulette wheels, blackjack tables, poker-faced players at poker tables, and elegant, cordoned-off, black-tie, baccarat tables.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.\n\n\nSHERBERT: (Introducing the EXECS to ACE)\n\n\n...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS/HARD COUNT ROOM - NIGHT Dolly back from a wall of money. An employee pours a bucket full of coins into a trough. Camera follows progress as numerous coins move on a conveyor system, through a sorting machine. Camera reveals several rolls of coins on a lower conveyor as they move up a ladder towards an employee's hands, who then places the rolls on a rack.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...comes cash. Tons of it. I mean, what do you think we're doing out here in the middle of the desert? It's all this money. This is the end result of all the bright lights and the comped trips, of all the champagne and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze. It's all been arranged just for us to get your money. That's the truth about Las Vegas.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS/FLOOR/SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY Camera follows JOHN NANCE carrying a small suitcase and walking through the casino to a door leading to the cashier's cage. The sign on the door reads 'Authorized Personnel Only'. He walks through the cage, to another door: 'Notice - Keep Out'.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) We're the only winners. The players don't stand a chance. And their cash flows from the tables to our boxes ...through the cage and into the most sacred room in the casino ...the place where they add up all the money ...the holy of holies ...the count room.\n\n\nHe opens the door. We see inside the count room from NANCE'S point of view. It looks like the area behind a teller's cage in a bank. A large room, windowless, decor-free. One side is a mesh cage, opened to reveal stacks of cash boxes. Several COUNTERS in white shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and sorting paper money.)\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Now this place was off limits.\n\n\nCOUNTER #1: Verify two thousand.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Even I couldn't get inside, but it was my job to keep it filled with cash. That's for sure.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) They had so much fuckin' money in there, you could build a house out of stacks of $100 bills. And the best part was that upstairs, the board of directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.\n\n\nAt one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and rapidly count the cash at a counting table. The camera follows a cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a clerk. He pours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a video camera. COUNTER #2 rapidly counts the cash and announces:\n\n\nCOUNTER #2: Five thousand.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) I mean, to them everything looked on the up and up. Right? Wrong.\n\n\nThe first counter recounts the cash.\n\n\nCOUNTER #1: Verify five thousand.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) The guys inside the counting room...\n\n\nStacks of bills lie nearby. The camera pans across the room to another table manned by a COUNT ROOM EXECUTIVE who repeats the figure and writes it down on a master list.\n\n\nCOUNT ROOM EXEC: Five thousand.\n\n\nWe move back to NANCE opening a cabinet full of stacks of $100 bills. He opens his suitcase and begins to fill it with cash. As he does this, the workers studiously look in other directions.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.  They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd even take cash right out of the drop boxes. And it was up to this guy right here [NANCE], standin' in front of about two million dollars, to skim the cash off the top without anybody gettin' wise ...the IRS or anybody.\n\n\nCOUNTER #1: Verify two hundred.\n\n\nNANCE closes the case and walks out. One of the counters dumps another container of money on the table.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Now, notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything. Somehow, somebody's always lookin' the other way. Now, look at these guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy, right?  They're countin' money. Who wants to bother them? I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.\n\n\nNANCE exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of the casino, passing ACE and SHERBERT, to a side exit door.\n\n\nNICKY: Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra c-note a week just to watch the door.  I mean, it's routine. Business as usual: in, out, hello, goodbye. And that's all there is to it. Just another fat fuck walkin' out of the casino with a suitcase. Now, that suitcase was goin' straight to one place: right to Kansas City ...which was as close to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go without gettin' themselves arrested.\n\n\nNANCE leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the curb. EXT. KANSAS CITY AIRPORT - DAY NANCE arrives. He is greeted by ARTIE PISCANO, a gray-haired sixty-year-old underboss. TITLE IN: 'KANSAS CITY'\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted ...and they wanted it every month.\n\n\nPISCANO: Hey, John, how are you? How was your ride?\n\n\nEXT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY NANCE, with suitcase, and PISCANO leave the car and enter the produce market.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Now this old Mormon fuck here... \n\n\nCUT TO: NANCE, AS HE GETS OUT OF PISCANO'S CAR\n\n\nINT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY NANCE and PISCANO walk through the grocery store, through the warehouse, past various employees to a doorway leading into the back room, where they are greeted by five older men around a large wooden table with bowls of macaroni and old jelly glasses filled with red wine.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy.\n\n\nNANCE: Somethin' smells good.\n\n\nPISCANO: Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) The bosses would come from all over the place: Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee. All over the Midwest. And they would meet in the back of this produce market in Kansas City. I mean, nobody even knew.\n\n\nNANCE shakes hands with AMERICO CAPELLI, sixty-eight, a bald, affable Milwaukee entrepreneur and ARTHUR CAPP, his thirty- year-old yuppie lawyer son. Camera continues to pan around the room.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) One of the guys made his mother do all the cooking.\n\n\nOn VINCENT BORELLI, seventy-year-old Kansas City boss.\n\n\nBORELLI: Did you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?\n\n\nOn VINNIE FORLANO, mid-seventies, an old-timer who once drove for Capone and is now Remo Gaggi's right-hand man.\n\n\nFORLANO: Jerry Steriano?\n\n\nBORELLI: Yeah.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Now, these old greaseballs might not look it, but believe me, these are the guys who secretly controlled Las Vegas.\n\n\nPISCANO joins his MOTHER and DAUGHTER by a stove.\n\n\nPISCANO'S MOTHER: That man's here again.\n\n\nPiscano dips a piece of bread into a pot of tomato sauce.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Because they controlled the Teamsters' Union, and that's where you had to go if you wanted to borrow money to buy a casino.\n\n\nBORELLI: (O.S.) When you've finished with him, I want him.\n\n\nPISCANO'S MOTHER: (Carrying a plate of food to the table where BORELLI and FORLANO are seated.)\n\n\nHere you are, gentlemen.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) And nobody got a Teamsters' loan, unless the guys in this room knew they were gonna get their little suitcases.\n\n\nFORLANO gets up from the table and walks toward NANCE.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Guys like this antique here [FORLANO], out of Detroit. Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top boss.\n\n\nNANCE embraces REMO GAGGI who's seated on a couch, and sits across from him.\n\n\nGAGGI: You got a round figure on it?\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Definitely the most important guy in this room.\n\n\nNANCE: (Picking up the suitcase)\n\n\nAbout twenty pounds.\n\n\nGAGGI: So?\n\n\nNANCE: That's around seven hundred thousand.\n\n\nGAGGI: Uh-huh, good.\n\n\nNANCE opens the case to reveal the money.\n\n\nANDY STONE: (Off-screen, from following scene)\n\n\nI know it's a little early for Las Vegas... INT. TANGIERS EXECUTIVE OFFICE PRESS CONFERENCE/BANQUET ROOM - DAY Camera tilts down a model of the Tangiers Hotel and Casino, then reveals the cover of Business Week magazine with a drawing of PHILIP GREEN, a young corporate type, smiling out under the headline: 'Philip Green, Vegas Wunderkind'.\n\n\nSTONE: (O.S.) ...but I do want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry.\n\n\nOn ANDY STONE, a middle-aged man at a podium giving a speech while GREEN, seated at a table, looks on. PHOTOGRAPHERS flash their cameras. ACE and SHERBERT, sitting next to GREEN, also watch the photo op ceremony.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.\n\n\nSTONE: This is a very auspicious occasion.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) A powerful man.\n\n\nSTONE: Philip, if you would rise.\n\n\nGreen stands up.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) He even played golf with the President.\n\n\nSTONE: On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...\n\n\nSTONE: (Handing GREEN a large cardboard facsimile 'check')\n\n\n...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.\n\n\nGREEN: Thank you.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...he did what he was told.\n\n\nPHILIP GREEN, who is now the head of the Tangiers Hotel and Casino Corporation, is standing at the podium giving a speech.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Now here was the perfect front man. I mean, what the fuck else could he be?  He didn't know too much. He didn't want to know too much, especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him the money. He wanted to believe the Teamsters gave him all that fuckin' money 'cause he was smart.\n\n\nAn exploding flash bulb fills the screen.\n\n\nGREEN: ...I say that, knowing full well just how much competition we have in this great city.\n\n\nEXT. CHEAP MOTEL OFF HIGHWAY - DAY We see a MAN and a WOMAN swimming underwater. Camera reveals that they are in a motel swimming pool with glass portholes. Expensive cars are parked outside one of the rooms. Hoods stand around outside the door.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) And where they got Green from - who the fuck knows?  All I know is that Green was an Arizona real estate hustler, who barely had enough gas money to come and pick up his own fuckin' check...\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS EXECUTIVE OFFICE PRESS CONFERENCE/BANQUET ROOM - DAY We return to the press conference. Photographers snap away. In the background are six-foot blow-ups of the Business Week cover. The camera moves past GREEN, CAPP and several other men, past SHERBERT, to ACE.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Now, all they needed was somebody they could trust to run the casino. And who better than Ace?  I mean, he was already in Vegas a couple of years and he had the fuckin' place clocked.\n\n\nFREEZE FRAME ON ACE. INT. TANGIERS SWIMMING POOL - DAY Camera looks straight down from the top of a hotel to a large pool area.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) But typical Ace...\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS SWIMMING POOL/POOLSIDE - DAY STONE, in a bathing suit and robe, sits on a lounge chair with a telephone. ACE, in sports clothes, sits on another chair.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.\n\n\nACE: You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.\n\n\nSTONE: You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.\n\n\nACE: But what happens when they do find out?\n\n\nSTONE: Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.\n\n\nACE: (Exhales) It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.\n\n\nSTONE: You got it.\n\n\nACE: I'm serious. No interference.\n\n\nSTONE: Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.\n\n\nStone lights a cigarette. INT. TANGIERS CRAPS PIT - NIGHT ACE blows on a die.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) And that's how that got Ace to take over.\n\n\nACES's hands place the die into a micrometer.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) They wanted him because Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling.\n\n\nCamera swish tilts up to ACE, then swish pans to boxman, dealers and players watching him, trying to act calm.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) They worked out a real cute job title too.\n\n\nWe see the die in the micrometer.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Tangiers Public Relations Director.\n\n\nSatisfied the die is not loaded ACE sets it on the craps table, the camera cranes up to reveal the Tangiers Casino floor.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) But the only thing he ever directed was the casino. He made his first bet when he was fifteen years old, and he always made money. But he didn't bet like you or me.\n\n\nA DEALER is sliding chips, tossing them on to a craps table.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.\n\n\nACE: (Approaching the DEALER) Where the hell did you learn how to deal? (He reaches down, stacking and arranging the chips.)\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.\n\n\nACE: (To the chastised DEALER)\n\n\nPlace the checks properly. That's the way you do it.\n\n\nDEALER: Yes, sir.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) He had to know everything, this guy.\n\n\nDirect overhead tracking shot as ACE walks between two rows of gaming tables.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) He'd find out the kind of inside stuff nobody else knew, and that's what he'd put his money on.\n\n\nINT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT, BACK HOME, PRE-SEVENTIES - DAY ACE walks past two boxers sparring in a ring, through a doorway into a room where several gamblers are seated around a table.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Even back home, years ago, when we were first hangin' out together...\n\n\nTITLE IN: 'BACK HOME, YEARS AGO'\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...he'd know if the quarterback was on coke.\n\n\nACE is looking at the odds board for college football games. The bookie, LUCKY LARRY, is waiting for ACE to hand in his picks.\n\n\nACE: I'll take Columbia for twenty.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) If his girlfriend was knocked up.\n\n\nLUCKY LARRY: Twenty dimes on Columbia . . .\n\n\nAs soon as ACE bets, a man erases a number from the chalkboard and replaces it was a '6', changing the odds. Two GAMBLERS saunter from the room.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) He'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals. He even figured out the different bounce you got off the different kinds of wood they used on college basketball courts, you know?\n\n\nEXT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT PUBLIC PHONES - DAY The two GAMBLERS we saw sauntering out of the bookie joint are racing to the nearest public phones. Another GAMBLER has already beaten them to it.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) He'd be workin' on this shit day and night. There was nothin' about a game he was gonna bet that he didn't know.\n\n\nGAMBLER #1: (Into phone) Ace got down at six.\n\n\nGAMBLER #2: (Into phone) Charlie, hey. Rothstein got six.\n\n\nINT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT, SEVERAL DAYS LATER - DAY A bookie hands a stack of money to another bookie, who hands the money to ACE. ACE removes several bills from the top of the stack of winnings and holds them out to the BOOKIES.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Season after season, the prick was the only guaranteed winner I ever knew. But he was so serious about it all that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.  But...\n\n\nACE exits.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...that's just the way he was.\n\n\nINT. MOB SOCIAL CLUB BACK ROOM - NIGHT The room has an espresso machine and a saint's day calendar. Assorted hoods are listening to NICKY at the bar. Camera dollies to REMO GAGGI, at the rear table playing gin rummy with OLD MAN CAPO and losing. Every time the CAPO picks up a card, he's able to knock or get gin, sending GAGGI into a fit bemoaning his bad luck.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.\n\n\nGAGGI: (Slams down his cards and curses at his losing hands)\n\n\nMa che cazzo! [Italian-American slang for 'What a prick.'] All those fuckin' sweeps.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) I mean, unless Ace made his bet.\n\n\nGAGGI: That's enough now!\n\n\nOLD MAN CAPO: I can't contest the cards.\n\n\nGAGGI: Va fa 'n culo! [Italian-American slang for 'Fuck off'] (Summoning a young man.)\n\n\nJohnny!\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Ace made more money for them on a weekend than I could do heisting joints for a month.\n\n\nACE enters and walks to GAGGI's table.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Whatever Ace picked up on the street he told Remo.\n\n\nNICKY: (Walks over to ACE and whispers)\n\n\nHey, did you bring that thing?\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) You know, I mean fixed fights, doped horses, crooked fuckin' zebras... locked-in point spreads. He told fuckin' Remo everything. And to tell you the truth. I don't blame him.\n\n\nGAGGI stands up and shakes ACE's hand.\n\n\nGAGGI: Ace.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.\n\n\nGAGGI beams as ACE takes out an envelope filled with cash and hands it over to him. GAGGI sits back down and ACE, knowing his place, smiles and is about to leave.\n\n\nGAGGI: Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?\n\n\nACE: Well, that's why they paid so well.\n\n\nGAGGI: You see? (Chuckles.) Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?\n\n\nACE: Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?\n\n\nGAGGI: Okay. You come by the house?\n\n\nACE: I'll come by.\n\n\nGAGGI: Seven o'clock?\n\n\nACE: Seven o'clock.\n\n\nGAGGI gets up and kisses ACE as NICKY and OLD MAN CAPO look on.\n\n\nGAGGI: Good job, my boy. Keep it up. Okay, Ace?\n\n\nACE nods in agreement and leaves the room.\n\n\nGAGGI: (To NICKY) Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']\n\n\nNICKY: (To ACE) I'll be right out.\n\n\nGAGGI: T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? (pointing to the off- screen ACE)\n\n\nNICKY: Mm.\n\n\nGAGGI: Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.\n\n\nNICKY: Mm.\n\n\nGAGGI: Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.

There are other bar patrons in the background.\n\n\nJOE: (To the BARTENDER) Chase, couple of shooters for the ladies.\n\n\nBARTENDER: (O.S.) All right.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.\n\n\nNICKY: (To MARINO) They payin'?\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) How did Nicky collect?\n\n\nMARINO: They pay every week, like they're supposed to.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Don't ask.\n\n\nNICKY: Then where the fuck is the money? I don't see the money.\n\n\nACE enters, and greets the two girls.\n\n\nACE: Hi, Melissa. Heidi.\n\n\nBLONDE: Hi, Sam.\n\n\nJOE: (To the GIRLS) Who's this guy?\n\n\nMARINO: (To NICKY) Get the fuck out of here. It was nine. I laid nine.\n\n\nACE approaches NICKY and MARINO.\n\n\nNICKY: It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.\n\n\nACE: Eight.\n\n\nNICKY: If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.\n\n\nMARINO: Well, how come I laid nine?\n\n\nNICKY: 'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...\n\n\nACE notices a pen lying on the bar. He taps JOE on the shoulder.\n\n\nACE: (To JOE) Excuse me.\n\n\nJOE: What?\n\n\nACE: (He holds up the pen) Is this yours? Your pen?\n\n\nJOE: Yeah, that's my pen. Why?\n\n\nACE: I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.\n\n\nJOE: Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?\n\n\nNICKY looks over.\n\n\nACE: Well, I was just offering you the-\n\n\nNICKY moves towards JOE.\n\n\nJOE: (Turning his back to talk to the girls, referring to ACE)\n\n\nThis fuckin' asshole. NICKY grabs the pen out of ACE's hand.\n\n\nMAN #1: (To JOE) Look out!\n\n\nBefore ACE can react, NICKY grabs JOE and starts stabbing him in the neck with the pen.\n\n\nMAN #1: Joe! Look out, Joe! Look out!\n\n\nNICKY grunts while JOE gasps and groans. The BLONDE screams while NICKY's hand continues to plunge the pen into JOE's throat. JOE tumbles to the floor. NICKY pounces on him, still stabbing and now kicking. JOE whimpers.\n\n\nNICKY: What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!\n\n\nACE: (Over whimpers and pants)\n\n\nWait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy. ACE looks stunned. NICKY's still holding the bloody pen.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Listen...\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR, 1972 - NIGHT Camera swoops from a woman cheering as she wins at a slot- machine to a blackjack table, then to a roulette table and over to a craps table. Montage of very short cuts of chips being picked up, dice thrown, money being poured from a bucket, stacks of money.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...with me protecting Ace, he made a fortune for the bosses. I mean that's what got him to Vegas. He was a money machine. A tremendous earner for these guys.  As soon as he took over, he doubled the fuckin' drop. With Ace the casino never saw so much money. And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT Camera moves in on ACE as he looks out over the casino. Dealers deftly stack chips, scoop up losses and pay off winners. Chips and money are everywhere. In extreme close-up slow motion a die falls on to a table. INT.

They were close to the, you know, good old boys.\n\n\nACE: (To SHERBERT) Pay him six hundred a week, tell him to walk around and look smart.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) I mean, without us, these guys, they'd still be shovellin' mule shit.\n\n\nACE points at paper cups, empty glasses and the debris of silver dollar wrappings on the floor. DON WARD, the Slots Manager in Western garb, immediately starts picking up the debris. ACE looks at WARD sternly.\n\n\nACE: Ward, you gotta keep a cleaner station. If you need 'Mr Clean', page him, all right?\n\n\nWARD bends down and picks up some trash.\n\n\nWARD: It won't happen again, Sam.\n\n\nACE: Mr Rothstein.\n\n\nACE: (To SHERBERT) Is this guy just another dumb fuckin' white man, or what? What's his story?\n\n\nSHERBERT: We need this guy.\n\n\nACE: We can't get rid of him?\n\n\nSHERBERT: He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.\n\n\nACE: I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.\n\n\nThey exit. INT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - NIGHT A card shoe slides across the baccarat table. A state SENATOR, a little drunk, tips the dealer, kisses the blonder HOOKER with him, fills his pockets with his winnings and walks over to see ACE.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) These yokels ran the state.\n\n\nDEALER #1: Thank you very much, Senator.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) They passed the laws, they owned the courts.\n\n\nSENATOR: Hi, Ace.\n\n\nACE: Hello, Senator.\n\n\nThey shake hands.\n\n\nSENATOR: (To ACE) Hey, I need a room. Need a room.\n\n\nACE: Good to see ya. (To SHERBERT) William would you...\n\n\nThe SENATOR shakes hands with SHERBERT as the HOOKER joins them.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.\n\n\nSHERBERT: Nice to see you, Senator.\n\n\nACE: (To SHERBERT) Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.\n\n\nSHERBERT: Certainly. (Leads the way.) Senator.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Why not make them happy?\n\n\nSHERBERT: We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY The SENATOR unzips the HOOKER's dress, kisses her and walks through the bedroom doorway, looking over his shoulder to her as she takes off her dress and walks out of his sight.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) For politicians...\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - DAY ACE smoking a cigarette by the baccarat tables.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...like our state senator up there, everything was on the house.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY The SENATOR opens a bureau drawer and takes out a small velvet pouch and pours black $100 into his palm.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.)

TANGIERS, ICHIKAWA LUXURY SUITE - DAY K. K. ICHIKAWA a Japanese businessman, and a male associate pick up towels and soap from about the bedroom of their suite. A blonde woman checks herself in the mirror.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) It's a whale like K. K. Ichikawa, who plays thirty thousand dollars a hand in baccarat. That's the one you really gotta watch.\n\n\nICHIKAWA and his associate walk into the the suite's living- room and join a Japanese woman seated on a couch.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) He plays fast and big and he has the cash and the credit to turn out your lights. About a year ago, he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands.\n\n\nThey begin to stuff Tangiers soap and towels into their luggage.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Downstairs, he takes us for two million... and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels. Another billionaire cheapskate who loves his free rooms...\n\n\nEXT. TANGIERS JET, LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY The Tangiers jet with the Tangiers logo on its side as ICHIKAWA shakes ACE's hands before boarding. SHERBERT follows him and his associates aboard.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...free private jets, and two million of our money.\n\n\nACE: Nice to see you again.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) But we got him back. I had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz. DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nEXT. TANGIERS JET, STILL IN THE SAME SPOT - NIGHT SHERBERT apologizes to ICHIKAWA and his entourage as they all get off the jet.\n\n\nSHERBERT: Ken, I don't know what the hell went wrong. I'm awfully sorry.\n\n\nICHIKAWA: This is a big problem. Big problem.\n\n\nSHERBERT: I can't understand it. These mechanical things, you know, they happen. Hey, be-better here than (gesturing to the sky) up there, you know what I mean?\n\n\nINT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT RESERVATION DESK - NIGHT SHERBERT arguing with TICKET AGENT as ICHIKAWA and entourage look glum.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Then he missed the commercial flights connecting with Japan.\n\n\nAGENT: I'm so sorry. There's a convention in town, and all flights are booked.\n\n\nSHERBERT: A convention? (Turning to ICHIKAWA) I can't believe that there's a convention. It's never... ?\n\n\nICHIKAWA: What can I do?\n\n\nEXT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT A smiling ACE greets ICHIKAWA and his entourage as they drive up and get out of Tangiers limos.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.)

ICHIKAWA looks on.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) But I knew, the trick with whales like Ichikawa was that they can't bet small for long. He didn't think of it as winning ten thousand, he thought of it as losing ninety thousand.\n\n\nICHIKAWA places a larger bet.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) So, he upped his bets...\n\n\nA dealer picks up some chips from a rack and places them on the table. ICHIKAWA is now seated with stacks of chips in front of him.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...until he dropped his winnings back and gave up a million of his own cash. DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nICHIKAWA, hours later, his chips depleted. ACE and SHERBERT still watch from behind the barrier as millions in chips are back in the dealer's racks.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing...\n\n\nMove in on ACE as he smokes a cigarette.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...and keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose. In the end, we get it all.\n\n\nINT.

(He bends down to pick them up.)\n\n\nGamblers and dealers shout and yell. She picks up another rack of chips and tosses them into the air, then another, and another. Chips fly all over the casino. Everyone starts diving for chips. Dealers. Players. Security guards. Waitresses. Pit bosses. Bedlam. ACE and the two execs with him are the only ones not diving for chips. He looks at GINGER.

GINGER'S APARTMENT - DAY GINGER enters the room with $25,000 in her hands. She taps LESTER DIAMOND's leg with it and he turns to her.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.\n\n\nLESTER: Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first.

The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.\n\n\nGINGER: Good luck.\n\n\nLESTER: Yeah.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.\n\n\nGINGER: Careful.\n\n\nGINGER looks out of the window and sees LESTER get into a convertible and drive off.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) I mean, the guy was always broke, he always had a story. And somehow, she could never turn him down. The way Ginger saw it, I guess, was that Lester was just an unlucky guy. Somebody had to take care of him.\n\n\nINT. BACK HOME AIRPORT/CUSTOMS - DAY NICKY, his wife JENNIFER, with a beehive hairdo, and their eight-year-old son LITTLE NICKY, are detained while their luggage is searched by a customs agent. TITLE IN: 'BACK HOME'\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) But nobody had to take care of Nicky.\n\n\nNICKY: (To customs agent) You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.\n\n\nJENNIFER: (To customs agent) Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!\n\n\nNICKY: Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.\n\n\nWe see MARINO waiting for NICKY outside the customs area. Two COPS push past him.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.\n\n\nCOP #1: (To MARINO) Excuse me.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.\n\n\nCAMERA DOLLIES IN ON JENNIFER'S BEEHIVE.\n\n\nJENNIFER: Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.\n\n\nFLASH FORWARD - INT. NICKY'S HOUSE/BACK HOME - DAY NICKY, JENNIFER, LITTLE NICKY and MARINO walk in.\n\n\nJENNIFER: (To LITTLE NICKY) You go and put your things away.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) And they were usually right.\n\n\nNICKY, JENNIFER and MARINO are gathered around the kitchen table. JENNIFER leans over and starts to shake her hair.\n\n\nMARINO: Whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n\nNICKY: Hold it, hold it. Here.\n\n\nNICKY places a red towel down on the table. JENNIFER leans over again, tugs and shakes her hair until diamonds begin to fall out of her beehive.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.\n\n\nJENNIFER: Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.\n\n\nDiamonds fall on the red towel in slow motion.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.\n\n\nJENNIFER: All right, we're clear.\n\n\nNICKY: There's more!\n\n\nJENNIFER: I think that's it.\n\n\nNICKY: There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.\n\n\nJENNIFER: God, I'm telling you, they're out!\n\n\nNICKY: Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.\n\n\nNICKY grasps JENNIFER's hair.\n\n\nJENNIFER: Look, there aren't... (A diamond falls out of her beehive.)\n\n\nThere aren't but...\n\n\nNICKY: Oh, there aren't? (Showing her the diamond.)\n\n\nWhat's that? (Slaps her.) Huh? What's that. (FRANK chuckles.) There's no more. Thanks, hon. INT. BACK HOME AIRPORT/CUSTOMS - DAY ON NICKY.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) I couldn't wait to get my hands on Vegas.

SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT Mob bosses FORLANO, CAPELLI, GAGGI, BORELLI and PISCANO seated around the back room table eating and talking as in the opening vignette.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.)

ACE'S TANGIERS PENTHOUSE, LAS VEGAS - DAY ACE opens the door to NICKY and JENNIFER.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.\n\n\nACE: (Opening door) Hey.\n\n\nJENNIFER: Hey, how you doin'? (Kisses ACE.)\n\n\nNICKY: Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?\n\n\nJENNIFER and NICKY take in ACE's spectacular Vegas-style penthouse.\n\n\nJENNIFER: (Whispering) Wow.\n\n\nNICKY: Boy, look at this place, huh?\n\n\nJENNIFER: Incredible.\n\n\nNICKY: All right.\n\n\nACE: Welcome to Vegas.\n\n\nCAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL A SWEEPING VIEW OF THE LAS VEGAS SKYLINE.\n\n\nNICKY: Okay, Sammy.\n\n\nACE: Somethin', huh?\n\n\nNICKY: Yeah.\n\n\nACE: (Calling her over) Ginger.\n\n\nGINGER emerges from the bedroom. NICKY and JENNIFER are both stunned by her beauty.\n\n\nNICKY: (To ACE) Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?\n\n\nACE: Honey, come here.\n\n\nShe walks to them\n\n\nACE: This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.\n\n\nJENNIFER: (Shaking hands) Good to meet you.\n\n\nGINGER: Hi, Jennifer.\n\n\nNICKY: Pleasure. (Grasping GINGER's hand and kissing it.)\n\n\nVery nice to meet you.\n\n\nGINGER: Hi, how are you?\n\n\nNICKY: Okay, Sammy.\n\n\nINT. ACE'S CAR, LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT ACE and NICKY are driving through town, the neon lights of Vegas reflected in the windshield.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.\n\n\nNICKY: What do you think about me movin' out here? (ACE looks away.) What's the matter? You got a problem with that?\n\n\nACE: No, of course not.\n\n\nNICKY: (Playfully) You mean, I have your permission?\n\n\nACE: Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.\n\n\nNICKY: I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there. (Referring to the Vegas lights.)\n\n\nLook at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.\n\n\nACE: Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.\n\n\nNICKY: Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.\n\n\nACE gives NICKY a look. EXT./INT. LAS VEGAS SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT NICKY and MARINO pull up in their car and get out.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Ace saw Vegas one way.\n\n\nNICKY: You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?\n\n\nMARINO: Of course.\n\n\nThey walk into the sportsbook, past numerous bar patrons and gamblers to TONY, the bookie at a betting counter.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky? (Chuckles.) Nicky was the muscle.\n\n\nNICKY grabs TONY by the back of his neck.\n\n\nNICKY: Tony.\n\n\nTONY: Hey.\n\n\nNICKY: How you doin'?\n\n\nTONY: How you doin'?\n\n\nNICKY: All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?\n\n\nTONY: What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.\n\n\nNICKY: I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.\n\n\nTONY: You sure?\n\n\nNICKY: I'm positive.\n\n\nTONY: Well, I'm a little confused here.\n\n\nNICKY: You're a little confused?\n\n\nTONY: Yeah.\n\n\nNICKY: (Pointing to a window, above a counter with a tiny opening to talk through)\n\n\nMaybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money! TONY takes some money out of his coat pocket.\n\n\nTONY: (Groaning) I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.\n\n\nNICKY: Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!\n\n\nHe smacks the bookie on the head with the wad of money.\n\n\nTONY: (Gasps) My fuckin' head.\n\n\nNICKY: Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.\n\n\nMARINO: (Pointing to TONY) Smarten up.\n\n\nNICKY: (Walking out) You jag-off.\n\n\nCLASSROOM NUN: (O.S.) (From following scene) And now...\n\n\nINT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY NICKY and JENNIFER stand in the background with other parents listening to a NUN school teacher. LITTLE NICKY and other youngsters are seated at small children's desks.\n\n\nCLASSROOM NUN: ...Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first president.\n\n\nLITTLE NICKY: (Stepping up in front of the class to begin a speech)\n\n\nGeorge Washington was born in a...\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) But still, it was nice and quiet for a while. Ginger and I presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town, like regular Ozzie and Harriets.\n\n\nLITTLE NICKY: ...typical Virginia farmhouse.\n\n\nEXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY NICKY and DETECTIVE BOB JOHNSON are coaching their sons. JOHNSON pats LITTLE NICKY on the back and with encouraging words sends him running on to the field.\n\n\nDETECTIVE JOHNSON: (To LITTLE NICKY) Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.\n\n\nDETECTIVE JOHNSON: Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...\n\n\nDETECTIVE JOHNSON: Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.\n\n\nDETECTIVE JOHNSON: You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.\n\n\nNICKY: Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.\n\n\nDETECTIVE JOHNSON: It's instinctive, you know.\n\n\nNICKY: He tries to do everything...\n\n\nLITTLE NICKY hits the ball, NICKY and DETECTIVE JOHNSON applaud.\n\n\nNICKY: Ohh!\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS CASHIER'S CAGE CREDIT WINDOW - NIGHT NICKY saunters through the casino and up to EDDY and JERRY, two well-dressed hoods who are signing papers at the cashier's credit window near ACE and SHERBERT.\n\n\n$$MASK$$: (V.O.) Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand? (Chuckling.) Yeah, right, I'm sure.\n\n\nJERRY: (Shakes NICKY's hand) Hey, Nicky. How are you?\n\n\nNICKY: Hey, Eddy.\n\n\nEDDY: Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?\n\n\nNICKY: I'm over here now.\n\n\nJERRY/EDDY: (In unison) You're over here?\n\n\nJERRY: You're over here?\n\n\nNICKY: Yeah, I'm over here with him.\n\n\nSWISH PAN TO ACE WITH SHERBERT OFF TO THE SIDE.\n\n\nEDDY: Oh.\n\n\nJERRY: Oh.\n\n\nEDDY: We're waiting on Carmine.\n\n\nJERRY: Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.\n\n\nNICKY: Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.\n\n\nEDDY: Carmine left?\n\n\nNICKY: Uh-huh.\n\n\nJERRY: Carmine left?\n\n\nEDDY: He's gone?\n\n\nJERRY: He's not here?\n\n\nEDDY: Carmine's gone.\n\n\nNICKY: I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.\n\n\nEDDY: Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? (Shakes hands withNICKY.)\n\n\nNICKY: Oh, thanks, Eddy.\n\n\nJERRY: (Shakes NICKY's hand) Yeah, lots of luck. Lots of luck.\n\n\nNICKY: Hey, great, Jerry.\n\n\nThey walk away.\n\n\nNICKY: Good luck to you too.\n\n\nCREDIT CLERK: (To NICKY from behind the cage)\n\n\nHey, they forgot to sign their papers.\n\n\nNICKY: What?\n\n\nCREDIT CLERK: They forgot to sign their papers.\n\n\nNICKY: Yeah, they don't need those anymore.\n\n\nHe looks over to ACE and SHERBERT. NICKY smiles.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Out of respect, guys from other crews got away with a warning.\n\n\nACE taking a drag off his cigarette, nods an 'okay'.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Everybody else: watch out.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS CASINO/BLACKJACK TABLES - DAY A blackjack WINNER, who looks like a school teacher, with over $100,000 in chips before him has gathered a crowd.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Like these yokels here who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home, 'cause they're the morons who give you the most trouble. Even after we'd catch 'em, they'd try sneakin' back with beards and wigs and fake noses.\n\n\nACE and SHERBERT walk up to watch the WINNER who is playing all six hands at the blackjack table.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet. Like this guy. He's bettin' lavender chips at five hundred each with only one little problem. He's always guessed right. If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot. But in the end, they're all greedy.\n\n\nACE walks around the WINNER's table, past the crowd, to the pit. Behind him are more blackjack tables, dealers and players. ACE bends down and ties his shoelace.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) I saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it.\n\n\nThe DEALER's hands lift the corner of his hole card a half an inch to determine the casino's hand against the WINNER. The slightly exposed hole card is a six of clubs.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) He just wasn't protecting his hand. He was lifting his hole card way to high.\n\n\nON ACE'S FACE THEN TO HIS POV OF THE CARD, PAST A PIT BOSS, PANNING TO THE SIGNALER AT THE BLACKJACK TABLE TO THE RIGHT. THE SIGNALER IS SLUMPED DOWN IN HIS SEAT, TOSSING DOWN SOME CARDS AND SNEAKING LOOKS AT THE DEALER'S HAND AT THE WINNER'S TABLE.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Now, here's this guy...\n\n\nOVERHEAD PAN FROM THE SIGNALER SLUMPED IN HIS SEAT.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...reading the dealer's hole card...\n\n\nPAN CONTINUES PAST ACE TO REVEAL THE WINNER'S TABLE.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...and signaling his buddy [the WINNER] at this table.\n\n\nOVERHEAD DOLLY IN ON SIGNALER WHO APPEARS TO BE NERVOUSLY TAPPING HIS THIGH. We see through his trousers, that he is tapping a copper transmitter with a battery pack attached. Back at the WINNER's table we see inside his pant leg where a device strapped to his leg is receiving the impulse signal - buzz - buzz - buzz - from the SIGNALER.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) And that's just what these hustlers look for. They cruise from casino to casino, lookin' for weak dealers the way lions look for weak antelope.\n\n\nACE starts to get up.\n\n\nACE: (O.S.) (From following scene) Operator?\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS BLACKJACK TABLES/TELEPHONE - DAY ACE is on the house phone right near the SIGNALER's table.\n\n\nACE: This is Mr R. Get me Armstrong and Friday over at pit two right away.\n\n\nHe hangs up, and fixes his tie in the mirrored panel above the phone. OVERHEAD VIEW OF THE SIGNALER'S TABLE. VARIOUS SECURITY GUARDS SLOWLY BEGIN TO GATHER AROUND IT. ACE, waiting, lights a cigarette. ARMSTRONG joins ACE. They look towards the SIGNALER's table.\n\n\nACE: (To ARMSTRONG) BJ nineteen, second base, the beard [Blackjack table number 19, second position, man with the beard]\n\n\nACE: (Picks up the phone again.)\n\n\nOperator... I need Mr Happy, loud. On ACE's signal, WAITRESSES, one carrying a cake with a sparkling candle, start singing 'Happy Birthday', attracting the crowd's attention.\n\n\nWAITRESSES: (In unison) Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday, dear Jeff. Happy Birthday to you.\n\n\nGamblers cheer and applaud. ACE nods and ARMSTRONG lets a long metal object drop out from under his jacket sleeve and moves in close behind the SIGNALER, as though looking at the game. He presses the object - a cattle prod - under the SIGNALER's arm near his heart. The SIGNALER instantly goes into convulsions, falling to the floor gasping and groaning. Several SECURITY GUARDS grab the SIGNALER as he falls. ARMSTRONG walks away.\n\n\nSECURITY GUARD #1: Man down!\n\n\nThe WINNER sees what happened to his partner.\n\n\nSECURITY GUARD #1: Notify medical! We got a cardiac arrest here!\n\n\nSECURITY GUARD #2: He's fine, folks. Just give us some room, please!\n\n\nACE watches the scene. The guards lift the stunned SIGNALER to his feet and help him away from the table. Play is immediately resumed.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Watch it now.\n\n\nThe WINNER hurriedly places his chips into racks.\n\n\nSECURITY GUARD #1: (O.S.) Stand back!\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) They never know what hit them. And if and when...\n\n\nSECURITY GUARDS drag the SIGNALER out.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...they do find out they just got zapped by a cattle prod...\n\n\nSHERBERT follows the WINNER as he rushes away.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...they wish they really did have a heart attack.\n\n\nACE exits behind the GUARDS and the SIGNALER. INT. BASEMENT MAINTENANCE ROOM - NIGHT A grim, windowless utility room with tools on racks along the walls, some plain wooden chairs, and a workbench table.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Turns out this guy and his fuckin' pals, they were knockin' this place dead for years.\n\n\nSECURITY GUARD #1: He's got a wire on him.\n\n\nThe SIGNALER is roughly shoved into the room. A SECURITY GUARD tears his trousers down revealing the signaling device strapped to his leg.\n\n\nSIGNALER: Hey, hey, what are you doin', man?\n\n\nSECURITY GUARD #2: (Exposing the device) There it is! On the table!\n\n\nSECURITY GUARD #1: Cheater's justice!\n\n\nThe SIGNALER is slammed down face first on the bench and the two GUARDS spread his arms out on the table.\n\n\nSIGNALER: (In pain) Oh, God! Oh!\n\n\nAnother GUARD starts up a power saw and approaches the SIGNALER who is now pinned to the table. He starts to scream.\n\n\nSIGNALER: Hey, no! No! No!\n\n\nACE walks toward the table, gesturing for the GUARD to turn off the saw.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.\n\n\nACE: (To relieved SIGNALER) I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?\n\n\nSIGNALER: No.\n\n\nACE: Can't do it with both hands?\n\n\nSIGNALER: No, Sir.\n\n\nACE: Can you do it with your left hand?\n\n\nSIGNALER: Well, I... I never tried.\n\n\nACE: So, you're a righty?\n\n\nSIGNALER: Ye-yeah.\n\n\nACE nods to one of the GUARDS. Instantly a large rubber mallet smashes onto the man's right hand four times to the sound of screams. ACE watches.\n\n\nACE: Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.\n\n\nSIGNALER: God! (He moans and sits back.)\n\n\nWINNER: (O.S.) (From following scene) It's a hundred...\n\n\nINT. CASINO CASHIER'S CAGE AREA - NIGHT The WINNER has been standing outside the cashier's cage waiting for his $110,000 in chips to be cashed. SHERBERT walks up behind him.\n\n\nWINNER: ...a hundred ten.\n\n\nCASHIER: Yes, it is.\n\n\nWINNER: I think.\n\n\nCASHIER: Yes.\n\n\nWINNER: Okay.\n\n\nSHERBERT: Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.\n\n\nWINNER: Yeah.\n\n\nSHERBERT: (To CASHIER) Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?\n\n\nCASHIER: Yes.\n\n\nSHERBERT: A little privacy. And, by the way, send over a... nice bottle of champagne on ice, huh?\n\n\nCASHIER: Sure will.\n\n\nSHERBERT: Real special.  Somethin'... (To WINNER.) By the way...  I'm Billy Sherbert, your casino manager.\n\n\nHe shakes hands with the WINNER.\n\n\nWINNER: Hi.\n\n\nSHERBERT: Having a good time?\n\n\nSHERBERT leads him away from the cage.\n\n\nWINNER: Yes, uh...\n\n\nSHERBERT: You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...\n\n\nWINNER: Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?\n\n\nINT. BASEMENT MAINTENANCE ROOM - NIGHT The WINNER is pushed through the door by two GUARDS followed by SHERBERT and sees his pal moaning in pain and holding his broken hand.\n\n\nSIGNALER: Look what they did to my hand, man!\n\n\nACE: (Walks over to the WINNER)\n\n\nAll right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want? SHERBERT stands next to the WINNER\n\n\nWINNER: I just wanna get out of here.\n\n\nACE: And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?\n\n\nWINNER: I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.\n\n\nACE: You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?\n\n\nWINNER: Yeah.\n\n\nACE: Get out of here.\n\n\nWINNER: Thank you.\n\n\nThe GUARDS usher the WINNER out of the room.\n\n\nACE: (To the GUARDS, referring to the SIGNALER)\n\n\nThrow him out in the alley.  And just tell the cops he got hit by a car. INT. ACE'S TANGIERS PENTHOUSE ACE and GINGER are alone in the living room. The apartment looks out on the glittering neon signs of the Strip.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.\n\n\nACE: We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?\n\n\nGINGER: What, are you trying to handicap me?\n\n\nACE: I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me? (GINGER looks doubtful.) I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.\n\n\nGINGER: (Sighs, laughing) You got the wrong girl, Sam.\n\n\nACE: I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.\n\n\nGINGER: You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?\n\n\nACE: I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.\n\n\nGINGER: You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.\n\n\nACE: Yeah, I know all that.\n\n\nGINGER: I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.\n\n\nACE: (Brushing cigarette ash off his dressing gown)\n\n\nI - I - I...\n\n\nGINGER: Understand? (Pause) I'm sorry.\n\n\nACE: No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.\n\n\nGINGER: If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?\n\n\nACE: You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.\n\n\nGINGER: (Interrupts) What're you... what're you pitching me, here?\n\n\nACE: Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you. (Pause) Want to take a chance?\n\n\nShe looks at him. ACE is holding her hand tightly. INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM MARRIAGE - NIGHT ACE and GINGER are seated at a banquet table with various guests, drinking champagne. AMY, their six-month-old child is in a cradle.

City Officials, politicians and gaming officials are there, plus, SHERBERT and Ace's boss, PHILIP GREEN. A photographer takes pictures of the guests.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -\n\n\nWe see AMY in the cradle.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) - he still covered his bets. They had to have the baby first, before they got married. Even made Jennie and me watch Amy for a few days when they went on their honeymoon.

Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?\n\n\nACE kisses GINGER.\n\n\nGINGER: You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.\n\n\nACE: The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.\n\n\nGINGER: (Putting on a gold bracelet)\n\n\nCome on. Can I keep this one in the house?\n\n\nACE: Now look, (gently holding her face, gathering her total attention)\n\n\npay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.\n\n\nGINGER: Okay.\n\n\nACE: All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust.

ACE and GINGER are closing a large box so crammed with cash that ACE has to lean on it for the clasp to lock.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.\n\n\nGINGER: Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.\n\n\nACE and GINGER struggle to push the crammed box into a slot in the wall.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) And, since I'd either be in jail or locked in a closet when I needed the money the most...\n\n\nThe BANK PRESIDENT joins them, and he and ACE simultaneously double-lock the outer safe box door with two separate keys, after which, ACE gives GINGER his key.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive.\n\n\nINT. BANK PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY GINGER is on the other side of a glass wall, signing papers.\n\n\nBANKER: Now this is just a signature card.\n\n\nACE: So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?

Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.\n\n\nACE: (Quietly) Yeah, sure I do. Why?\n\n\nBANKER: No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.\n\n\nACE: Well...\n\n\nACE looks over to GINGER, smiles and winks. She looks back at him. INT.

With Ginger and the money in place, I felt covered, and to play it safe I switched job titles again and made myself, um, Food and Beverage Director. This way nobody would bother me about a license. I mean, Vegas was like a dream for me. Trouble was...\n\n\nNICKY is seated at another table with MARINO, peeling off money and giving it to MIKE, a crooked dealer.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.\n\n\nMARINO: (To MIKE) Don't make us come lookin' for you.\n\n\nMIKE: Oh, you won't have to look for me. I appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky.\n\n\nNICKY: All right, Mike.\n\n\nMIKE gets up from the table.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks.

Nicky thought nobody was watching him. But he was wrong.\n\n\nWe see two undercover gaming agents, looking like tourists, sneaking looks at NICKY's table.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.\n\n\nNICKY: Four aces, Doc.\n\n\nHis hands spread five cards on the table, showing four aces.\n\n\nNICKY: What do you got?\n\n\nDOCTOR DAN: (Getting up in disgust) Jesus Christ. I can't believe it.\n\n\nCOWBOY, the card shark with the cowboy hat, rakes in a large pot toward his side of the table.\n\n\nDOCTOR DAN: If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck. I'm out of here, you understand?\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) I mean, I wished to God Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost.\n\n\nHe walks towards NICKY's table.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) What am I gonna do? Go back home and start a war?\n\n\nACE leans down to talk to NICKY.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.\n\n\nACE: (Whispering in NICKY's ear)\n\n\nBe careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.\n\n\nNICKY: So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?\n\n\nACE: You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.\n\n\nACE walks away. NICKY looks over at the gaming agents.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Ace was so fuckin' worried about his casino, he forgot what we were doin' out here in the first place.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT Security people are pulling apart a husband and wife who are fighting. Camera picks up ACE as he passes by them.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.)

Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint? SHERBERT approaches COWBOY.\n\n\nSHERBERT: Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table and putting your shoes on, please?\n\n\nCOWBOY: (Sighs) Yeah, I would mind. I'm havin' a bad night.\n\n\nCOWBOY remains the same with his feet on the table.\n\n\nSHERBERT: (Returning to ACE) Fuckin' asshole won't budge.\n\n\nACE: Call security.\n\n\nACE approaches COWBOY.\n\n\nACE: How are you?\n\n\nCOWBOY: Good.

He gives it to JONATHAN and DAVID as reporters rush in to photograph the moment.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) You know, Ace could be a very touchy guy, especially when he got bigger and bigger in town.

BACKSTAGE TANGIERS THEATER - DAY ACE and SHERBERT watch as a STAGE MANAGER weighs in the 'Femme Fatale' Showgirls.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.\n\n\nACE: (To SHOWGIRL) You're still eight pounds over. (To MANAGER.)

Listen...\n\n\nSTAGE MANAGER: ...and she doesn't always -\n\n\nACE: ...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.\n\n\nSTAGE MANAGER: But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.\n\n\nACE: That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.\n\n\nSTAGE MANAGER: It's always been our policy -\n\n\nACE: No. Just stop everything.\n\n\nSHERBERT and ACE walk away across a huge stage.\n\n\nSHERBERT: (To ACE) This woman's an institution.\n\n\nACE: I don't care what she is.

Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Between...\n\n\nEXT.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT ACE and NICKY are standing on the casino floor near the slot- machines. Gamblers are milling about behind them.\n\n\nACE: You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.\n\n\nNICKY: Why, somebody's complaining?\n\n\nACE: I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.\n\n\nNICKY: That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.\n\n\nACE: Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.\n\n\nNICKY: What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.\n\n\nACE: I'm just tellin' you.

I mean, we even stuck ice-picks in his balls.\n\n\nNICKY: You better hope he gives me a fuckin' name soon, or I'm gonna give him yours, Frank.\n\n\nMARINO and BLUE lay DOGS on the table and put his head in a vise. They're exhausted from beating him.\n\n\nMARINO: (To NICKY) Yeah, thanks a lot.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) But he never talked.\n\n\nNICKY: (To MARINO) I know you would have ratted by now.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) In the end, I had to put his fuckin' head in a vise.\n\n\nNICKY: Dogs. Dogs, can your hear me, Dogs?\n\n\nDOGS gasps and mumbles.\n\n\nNICKY: Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.\n\n\nTONY DOGS: (With what strength he as left)\n\n\nFuck you!\n\n\nNICKY: (To MARINO and BLUE) This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights! (To DOGS.) Fuck me?\n\n\nNICKY begins to tighten the vise.\n\n\nNICKY: Fuck me, you motherfucker? (Turning the vise.) Fuck my mother? That's what you fuckin' tell me?\n\n\nNICKY angrily keeps spinning the vise handle until suddenly one of DOGS's eyes bulges out of the socket.\n\n\nNICKY: Huh? You motherfucker, you, huh?\n\n\nMARINO and BLUE are horrified by the sight. Everybody freezes.\n\n\nNICKY: Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!\n\n\nTONY DOGS: Ch-Charlie M!\n\n\nNICKY: Charlie M?\n\n\nTONY DOGS: (Blood streaming out of his mouth)\n\n\nCharlie M.\n\n\nNICKY: (Screaming) Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!\n\n\nTONY DOGS: (Pleading) Kill me, you fuck, kill me.\n\n\nNICKY: Kill you, (unwinds the crank) You motherfucker you! (To MARINO.) Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) The word got around that finally...\n\n\nMARINO places a knife against DOGS's neck.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...there was a real gangster in town. Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.\n\n\nWe hear DOGS gasp as the knife slices his throat.\n\n\nNICKY: Charlie M!\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - DAY Extreme close-up of a slot-machine. Four reels with sevens across. Suddenly, the power goes out. Lights die down.. Machine 'waaaooows' down to a dead stop. Security guards, on their hands and knees, are pulling the plugs on the three giant $15,000 progressive machines, as ACE talks to DON WARD.\n\n\nACE: Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?\n\n\nWARD: Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.\n\n\nACE: Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?\n\n\nWARD: Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.\n\n\nACE: You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?\n\n\nWARD: Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.\n\n\nACE: Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!\n\n\nWARD: Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.\n\n\nACE: Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.\n\n\nSHERBERT enters, stands next to ACE.\n\n\nACE: The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?\n\n\nWARD: I really think you're -\n\n\nACE: (Interrupts) You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?\n\n\nWARD: I really think you're overreacting in this whole -\n\n\nACE: (Interrupts) Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.\n\n\nWARD: You're firin' me?\n\n\nACE: I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin' (mocking WARD) I'm firin' you, you -\n\n\nGives SHERBERT a look.\n\n\nWARD: You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.\n\n\nACE: I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.\n\n\nWARD: This is not the way to treat people.\n\n\nACE: Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on. (To SHERBERT.) Let's go.\n\n\nACE and SHERBERT walk off, WARD turns to leave. INT. TANGIERS CASINO, AKU-AKU LOUNGE - DAY, AN HOUR LATER ACE and GREEN are seated having coffee and muffins in the Hawaiian lounge by the casino floor.\n\n\nACE: I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.\n\n\nGREEN: But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.\n\n\nACE: So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.\n\n\nGREEN: This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.\n\n\nACE: Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here.\n\n\nBreaks open his blueberry muffin, puts it down and points to Green's.\n\n\nACE: Look at yours.\n\n\nGREEN: What?\n\n\nACE: Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.\n\n\nGREEN: What are you talking about?\n\n\nACE: It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.\n\n\nGREEN follows ACE to the kitchen.\n\n\nGREEN: Where you goin'?\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS KITCHEN - DAY ACE, GREEN and the BAKER are gathered around the BAKER's counter surrounded by muffin tins and batter.\n\n\nACE: (Handing the BAKER the two muffins)\n\n\nFrom now on I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin. An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.\n\n\nBAKER: You know how long that's going to take?\n\n\nACE: I don't care how long it takes. Put an equal amount in each muffin.\n\n\nACE leaves, GREEN looks on in amazement as the BAKER holds the muffins. GREEN follows ACE out. INT. ACE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY ACE, seated at the kitchen table, is feeding AMY in a high chair. The nanny is in the background.\n\n\nACE: Come on, honey, just a little. That a girl, that a girl. Oh, boy, look.\n\n\nGINGER enters and goes to the sink.\n\n\nACE: (To AMY, who is sobbing and mumbling)\n\n\nOkay, want to go with Mommy?\n\n\nACE: What do you need?\n\n\nGINGER: (Giving AMY to the NANNY)\n\n\nYou get her?  Okay. (To ACE.) Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.\n\n\nACE: Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.\n\n\nGINGER: Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.\n\n\nShe sits down at the table next to him.\n\n\nACE: Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?\n\n\nGINGER: (Picking up an empty carton of milk)\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\nACE: Why do you need that much?\n\n\nGINGER: Well, what's the difference? I just need it.\n\n\nACE: Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...\n\n\nGINGER: I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal. (Getting up to the refrigerator.)\n\n\nOkay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.\n\n\nACE: Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.\n\n\nGINGER, annoyed, closes the refrigerator door.\n\n\nACE: Why can't you tell me what it's for?\n\n\nShe stirs her coffee.\n\n\nACE: Huh? (Pause) Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?\n\n\nGINGER: No.\n\n\nACE: Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?\n\n\nGINGER: Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.\n\n\nACE: What are you talkin' a- ?\n\n\nGINGER: (Interrupting) Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?\n\n\nACE: You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you? (She doesn't answer.) Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?\n\n\nGINGER: (Quietly) You can trust me.\n\n\nACE: Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.\n\n\nGINGER gives him a look and leaves. INT. VEGAS BANK VAULT - DAY GINGER takes about two inches of $100 bills out of a safe deposit box and slips it in an envelope. EXT. VEGAS/BANK/PUBLIC PHONE - DAY NICKY is on a phone watching GINGER leave the bank.\n\n\nNICKY: (Into telephone) Yeah, she's leavin' the bank now. All right, I'm gonna follow her. (He hangs up.)\n\n\nINT. SALVADORAN DINER BOOTH - DAY GINGER is in a booth with LESTER DIAMOND, handing him the envelope filled with money.\n\n\nLESTER: What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?\n\n\nGINGER: It means I got the money.\n\n\nLESTER: You got money. That's a - That's a good look.\n\n\nSWISH PAN TO ACE ENTERING, FOLLOWED BY A HOOD. HE SITS DOWN AT THE BOOTH WITH LESTER AND GINGER.\n\n\nACE: How you doin', Les? It's Lester, right? Sam.\n\n\nExtends his hand to LESTER, who shakes it.\n\n\nACE: From my recollection, aren't you the card shark... the golf hustler... the pimp from Beverly Hills?\n\n\nLESTER gives GINGER a 'how did you fuck this up?' Look.\n\n\nACE: If I'm wrong, please correct me, 'cause I never knew you to be a heist man. (LESTER sighs.) But if you are, you know what... here, take mine too.\n\n\nACE takes some money out of his coat and puts the thick wad of bills on the table.\n\n\nACE: Go ahead, take it. 'Cause you already have hers.\n\n\nLESTER turns and sees two HOODS standing by the front and back doors of the diner.\n\n\nACE: She's my wife. (To LESTER.) Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.\n\n\nLESTER: Yeah, yeah. I know that.\n\n\nACE: You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.\n\n\nAfter stammering for a moment, LESTER gets up and begins to move towards the back door.\n\n\nLESTER: (Quietly) Okay.\n\n\nACE: You fuckin' piece of shit.\n\n\nLESTER: Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck?\n\n\nThe thugs follow him out of the back door. GINGER freezes.\n\n\nACE: You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?\n\n\nGINGER: (Whispering) No, he didn't.\n\n\nACE: (Picks up the money) Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'\n\n\nACE takes GINGER by the arm to the rear of the diner where they can see the parking area through a glass door.\n\n\nACE: Come here, I want to show you somethin'.\n\n\nEXT. REAR OF SALVADORAN DINER, PARKING LOT - DAY Three HOODS rush LESTER who is running towards his car. GINGER bursts through the doors, trying to get to LESTER. ACE holds her back. They struggle. LESTER groans and gasps as the HOODS start to beat him up.\n\n\nHOOD #1: You fuckin' shit.\n\n\nGINGER: No! No! No! Don't!\n\n\nACE restrains her. The HOODS punch LESTER in the face and stomach.\n\n\nGINGER: Make them stop it! (Sobbing.) No! No! No! It's not his fault! It's my fault!\n\n\nNICKY watches from a car in a parking lot across the street, out of GINGER's sight. ACE forces GINGER into the car as the HOODS finish the beating.\n\n\nGINGER: (Sobbing) No! No!\n\n\nThe HOODS toss LESTER into his car.\n\n\nLESTER: (Falling into the front seat on his back.)\n\n\nFuck! NICKY watches as the HOODS walk away from LESTER's car.\n\n\nLESTER: Fuck you!\n\n\nHOOD #2: You piece of shit.\n\n\nACE pulls out of the parking lot with a wailing GINGER. LESTER groans, trying to sit up.\n\n\nLESTER: (As ACE and GINGER drive off down the street)\n\n\nCouldn't do it yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker! INT. GOLD RUSH BACK ROOM - DAY GINGER and NICKY are in the back room. NICKY is sitting on a couch while GINGER stands by a mirror with a curling iron.\n\n\nGINGER: (Throwing the iron on the counter)\n\n\nHe's such a prick. He had some guy from the hotel beat him up. He didn't want to do it himself. Oh, no, he didn't want to get his own hands dirty. She takes a pill with a drink.\n\n\nGINGER: So, why'd he have to do that, huh?\n\n\nShe walks towards NICKY, who is sitting on a couch across the room.\n\n\nGINGER: Tell me.\n\n\nNICKY: I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -\n\n\nGINGER: (Interrupts) Yeah, no shit.\n\n\nShe sits down next to NICKY.\n\n\nNICKY: Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.\n\n\nGINGER: No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.\n\n\nNICKY: Oh, you did? I didn't know that.\n\n\nGINGER: Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?\n\n\nNICKY: You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...\n\n\nShe smiles.\n\n\nNICKY: I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.\n\n\nGINGER: Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.\n\n\nNICKY: Sure.\n\n\nGINGER: Am I right?\n\n\nNICKY: I can see that. Sure.\n\n\nGINGER: So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.\n\n\nNICKY: You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?\n\n\nGINGER: Mm, you want to steal it? (Cracking a smile.)\n\n\nNICKY: No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.\n\n\nGINGER: I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. (Sniffs.)\n\n\nNICKY: Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?\n\n\nGINGER: I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality. (Breaking down.) Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake. (Sniffs.) I mean it.\n\n\nNICKY: I know what you mean.\n\n\nHe moves closer to her.\n\n\nNICKY: Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.\n\n\nGINGER: I do.\n\n\nNICKY: I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.\n\n\nGINGER: He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.\n\n\nShe gets up and walks to the counter by the mirror.\n\n\nGINGER: He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?\n\n\nNICKY: Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.\n\n\nGINGER: (Sighs, her voice starts to crack)\n\n\nHe gives a fuck what I do?\n\n\nNICKY: (Getting up) Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.\n\n\nGINGER: Okay.\n\n\nNICKY: All right?\n\n\nGINGER: Yeah. (Walking over to him, smiling.)\n\n\nThanks. Towering over NICKY, holding a drink in one hand and his shoulder in the other, she leans down and kisses him.\n\n\nGINGER: Thanks for puttin' up with me.\n\n\nNICKY takes the drink out of her hand.\n\n\nNICKY: And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.\n\n\nGINGER: Oh, come on.\n\n\nNICKY: You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.\n\n\nGINGER: (Fidgeting with his jacket, then holding his face in her hands, smiling.)\n\n\nYou're so nice. (She begins to cry.)\n\n\nNICKY: Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.\n\n\nShe kisses him.\n\n\nGINGER: (Tenderly strokes his head)\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\nNICKY: Yeah.\n\n\nShe embraces NICKY, wrapping her arms around him.\n\n\nGINGER: (Through tears) Thank you.\n\n\nNICKY: (Feeling a little awkward with the hug)\n\n\nIt's all right. She kisses him again. NICKY doesn't move, holding back. INT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY Pull back from a sign, with a tiny 'yes' on top of a gigantic 'no', leaning on a window overlooking the sportsbook. We see ACE, behind his desk, taking a swig of Mylanta. His SECRETARY telephones. INT. ACE'S OUTER OFFICE, SECRETARY'S DESK - DAY We see past PAT WEBB's cowboy hat down onto Ace's SECRETARY on the phone.\n\n\nSECRETARY: (Into telephone) Mr Rothstein? County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you.\n\n\nACE: (Over telephone) Okay...\n\n\nINT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n\nACE: (Into telephone) ...give me a minute.\n\n\nSECRETARY: (Over telephone) Okay.\n\n\nACE hangs up the phone. INT. ACE'S OUTER OFFICE, SECRETARY'S DESK - DAY\n\n\nSECRETARY: (To WEBB) It'll just be a minute.\n\n\nINT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY ACE gets up from his desk and we see he is in his boxer shorts. He opens the closet and carefully puts on the trousers hanging inside. INT. ACE'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY A very patient WEBB is leaning against some double doors across from Ace's SECRETARY.\n\n\nSECRETARY: Mr Webb...  Can I get you anything?\n\n\nWEBB: Oh, no. (Cordially tipping his hat.)\n\n\nNo, thank you, little lady. INT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n\nACE: (Into telephone) Okay, send him in and call me four minutes after.\n\n\nWEBB walks in. He is big, tough and western, wearing a Stetson, tooled boots, jeans, an elbow-patched jacket and a turquoise bear claw string-tie. His headband contains a rattlesnake head. Ace's SECRETARY shuts the door on her way out.\n\n\nWEBB: Mr Rothstein... (With hand outstretched to ACE.)\n\n\nI'm Pat Webb.\n\n\nACE: How do you do?\n\n\nThey shake hands.\n\n\nWEBB: Hey, it is my pleasure.\n\n\nACE: Yeah, I heard a lot about you.\n\n\nWEBB: Oh, thank you, sir.\n\n\nLooking out Ace's office picture window overlooking the sportsbook.\n\n\nWEBB: Hey, house is doin' well. (Chuckling.) Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.\n\n\nACE: No, that's quite all right.\n\n\nTILT UP FROM WEBB'S SNAKESKIN COWBOY BOOTS AND ACE'S BLUE SHOES AS THEY CONTINUE TALKING.\n\n\nACE: Why don't you have a seat?\n\n\nWEBB: Hm? Oh. Thank you, sir.\n\n\nWEBB sits down in a chair in front of ACE's desk.\n\n\nWEBB: Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.\n\n\nACE: I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.\n\n\nWEBB: Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.\n\n\nACE: Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.\n\n\nWEBB: Are, uh - (Clears throat.) - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?\n\n\nACE: I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.\n\n\nWEBB: (Chuckling) You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar. (Chuckles.) But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.\n\n\nACE: I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.\n\n\nWEBB: Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?\n\n\nACE: (Pause) I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.\n\n\nThe telephone rings. ACE picks it up.\n\n\nACE: (Into telephone) Okay, thanks. (To WEBB.) Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.\n\n\nWEBB: Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor. (Pause.) Thank you for your time.\n\n\nACE: No problem. (Getting up and shaking hands.)\n\n\nSorry.\n\n\nWEBB: (Smiles slightly) You bet.\n\n\nINT. ACE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM/BEDROOM - DAY ACE, in pain from his ulcer, opens a bottle of pills in his bathroom and sees that it is almost empty.\n\n\nACE: What happened to my pills?\n\n\nHe leaves the bathroom and walks into the bedroom where GINGER is stretched out on their imperial bed.\n\n\nGINGER: Huh?\n\n\nACE: (Waving the pill bottle) Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?\n\n\nGINGER: I didn't take your pills.\n\n\nACE: Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?\n\n\nGINGER: (Sobbing) You didn't have to beat him up!\n\n\nACE: (Walking back to the bathroom)\n\n\nWhat? ACE puts the bottle into the medicine cabinet.\n\n\nGINGER: (Sobbing) I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!\n\n\nACE: Yeah, how do I know?\n\n\nGINGER: (Sobbing) You can't make me stop caring...\n\n\nACE: What? What?!\n\n\nGINGER: I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.\n\n\nShe starts to cry.\n\n\nACE: (Trying to calm her) Listen. (Stepping up to the bed.)\n\n\nGinger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -\n\n\nGINGER: (Interrupts) You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here. (Crying.) I am.\n\n\nShe sits up woozy, and tries to pull on her trousers.\n\n\nACE: (Walking around the bed to her)\n\n\nIt's okay.  Look... (holding her face, gently) ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.\n\n\nGINGER: Okay.\n\n\nACE: If not for me, at least for Amy.\n\n\nGINGER: (Sobbing) Okay, okay.\n\n\nACE: (Gently) You understand?

All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.\n\n\nACE: I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'?

And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?\n\n\nNICKY: Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license. (Pause.)

I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.\n\n\nNICKY: (Holding up the magazine)\n\n\nYou mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?\n\n\nACE: That's all taken out of context. Okay.\n\n\nNICKY: Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.\n\n\nACE: I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there.

Even your own wife.\n\n\nACE: My wife?\n\n\nNICKY: Yeah.\n\n\nACE: Now, what does she have to do with all this?\n\n\nNICKY: Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.\n\n\nACE: All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?\n\n\nNICKY: No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.\n\n\nACE: Listen, I would -\n\n\nNICKY: (Interrupting) The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.\n\n\nACE: I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay?

There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.\n\n\nNICKY: It's none of my business?\n\n\nACE: That's right, yeah.\n\n\nNICKY: A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.\n\n\nACE: Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.\n\n\nNICKY starts to walk out.\n\n\nACE: This guy is gonna run to the FBI.\n\n\nNICKY: Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino.

NICKY's car suddenly appears as a reflection in ACE's sunglasses, shaking ACE out of his desert-induced reverie. NICKY's car pulls up by ACE. He gets out and storms up to him.\n\n\nNICKY: Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?\n\n\nACE: What people?\n\n\nNICKY: What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?\n\n\nACE: I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.\n\n\nNICKY: No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!\n\n\nACE: I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.\n\n\nNICKY: You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!\n\n\nACE: Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass.

You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.\n\n\nACE: Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.\n\n\nNICKY: You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.\n\n\nACE: Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.\n\n\nNICKY: Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?\n\n\nACE: No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...\n\n\nNICKY: (Interrupting) Back -\n\n\nACE: ...you? Do you remember what I told you?\n\n\nNICKY: Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -\n\n\nACE: (Interrupting) You never - ?\n\n\nNICKY: Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again!

Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.\n\n\nDOMINICK: Yeah.

(To FEMALE DEALER.) Fuckers!  They take it, but they don't want to give it back. NICKY turns up another bad card and looks at the dealer. She smiles as she slides the house winnings over to her side of the table.\n\n\nNICKY: How the fuck can you grin? How the fuck could you grin?\n\n\nThe FEMALE DEALER looks to her PIT BOSS for help. He steps up to a MALE DEALER at a neighboring table.\n\n\nNICKY: You know how much I'm stuck? You give a fuck?\n\n\nThe MALE DEALER walks up to the FEMALE DEALER and taps her on the shoulder.\n\n\nNICKY: Do ya?!\n\n\nShe lays down some cards, claps her hands to show the Eye-in- the-Sky that they are empty, and exits.\n\n\nNICKY: (To departing FEMALE DEALER)\n\n\nYeah. Give yourself a hand right across your fuckin' mouth. The MALE DEALER takes her place behind the table.\n\n\nNICKY: Look at this fuckin' beaut they put in now.

You been beatin' all the customers tonight, motherfucker?\n\n\nWe see the PIT BOSS lock up the chip tray from the table the dealer has just left. NICKY has a diminished stack of chips and an upturned ten and a two.\n\n\nNICKY: Huh, jag-off? Hit me.\n\n\nThe card is a king or a 'paint', a picture card, meaning that NICKY has lost. Everyone freezes in fear. NICKY takes the paint and flicks it at the DEALER's chest where it sticks to his shirt.)\n\n\nNICKY: Take this stiff and pound it up your fuckin' ass! Hit me again.\n\n\nThe DEALER looks to the PIT BOSS who nods 'okay'. He turns over a card. It's another paint, a queen. NICKY flicks the card to the DEALER's face.\n\n\nNICKY: Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass! Hit me again.\n\n\nThe DEALER looks to the PIT BOSS again.\n\n\nNICKY: That's it, keep lookin' at him, you fuckin' dummy. If you had any fuckin' heart at all, you'd be out fuckin' stealin' for a livin'. (Tossing the card at the DEALER.)\n\n\nHit me again.

You gotta get out of here!\n\n\nNICKY: Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.\n\n\nACE: Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you.

Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.\n\n\nTo the PIT BOSS, holding up ten fingers.\n\n\nACE: Ten and that's it.\n\n\nHe makes a throat cutting gesture with his hand. ACE leaves. NICKY turns to walk back to the table. He sees SHERBERT standing right behind him.\n\n\nNICKY: What are you starin' at, you bald- headed Jew prick?!\n\n\nBefore SHERBERT can answer, NICKY grabs the receiver off a wall phone and hits him across the face and back. SHERBERT falls to the floor. NICKY pulls the cradle off the pillar and tosses it down on his back. He and MARINO walk back to the table, SHERBERT winces on the floor in shock.\n\n\nNICKY: Sue me, you Jew fuck!\n\n\nMARINO: Let's get out of here.\n\n\nNICKY: What? Get out of here?

You're even asking for alimony payments and... child support... and now custody.\n\n\nGINGER: I just want what any divorced woman would get.\n\n\nACE: I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be? (To GINGER.) Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me. (To OSCAR.)

He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.\n\n\nACE: (To GINGER, leaning closer to her)\n\n\nLook in my eyes. Look in my eyes. GINGER turns to him.\n\n\nACE: You know me. Do you see anything in these eyes that makes you think I would ever let someone in your condition take my child away from me? (Pause.) Do you?

She pecks his cheek before exiting to her own room. A security guard opens the door for ACE. We follow him past numerous showgirls and costumes.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...I could never reach her. I could never make her love me. I always felt she should have gone for all that money... being somebody for the first time in her life, a home and a kid. But that's not what happened. It just didn't work out that way.\n\n\nACE: (To the showgirls) Everything all right?\n\n\nACE: I mean, what could we do? After a while, we'd just take breathers from each other.

VEGAS RESTAURANT - NIGHT ACE and GINGER, dressed for dinner just like any other couple, walk towards a table overlooking the colorful lights of downtown Vegas.\n\n\nMAITRE D': ...good evening. Signora.\n\n\nGINGER: Gino.\n\n\nMAITRE D': This way.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) (as they are led to their table)\n\n\nThe good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.\n\n\nACE: (Seated across from GINGER at a booth)\n\n\nFirst of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.\n\n\nGINGER: I bought him a watch too.\n\n\nACE: Yeah.\n\n\nGINGER: Yeah.\n\n\nACE: But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?\n\n\nGINGER: Yeah.\n\n\nACE: At the most, which is impossible for him.\n\n\nShe glances to the table behind them.\n\n\nACE: Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?\n\n\nGINGER: (Staring down at her plate, trying to restrain herself)\n\n\nWould you knock it off, Sam?\n\n\nACE: I'm just tryin' to figure it out.\n\n\nGINGER: There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.\n\n\nShe lights a cigarette.\n\n\nACE: Yeah, but I've been told that before, 'We're workin' it out.' You think that you're home... after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favor to me?\n\n\nShe looks at ACE.\n\n\nACE: (Pause) So, counting the watch, let's say another four thousand for expenses over the weekend... of which you must have had a good time. I know he did.  That's for sure. I know that... fuckin' piece of shit had a good fuckin' time. On my money. You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway.\n\n\nGINGER glares at him.\n\n\nACE: You're lookin' at me a certain way. You - you're teary-eyed, huh? You're upset. You're a good actress, you know that?  Good fuckin' actress. You can fuckin' get that pity out of people. I'm not a john, you understand?  You always thought I was, but I'm not. And I'm not a sucker. That fuckin' pimp cocksucker. He's lucky I didn't kill him last time. Lucky he's fuckin' livin'. And if you would've stayed with Amy... and you would've ran away... you would've been fuckin' dead.\n\n\nGINGER scoots out of the booth and leaves.\n\n\nACE: Both of you. Dead. Dead.\n\n\nINT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Wide overhead of ACE alone in bed. Off-screen, we hear GINGER, a little drunk, on the phone.\n\n\nGINGER: (O.S.) (Whispering into telephone)\n\n\nI cannot do it anymore. I can't fuckin' live like this. It's not right. ACE's point of view as he moves towards the sound of GINGER's voice. He enters frame and stops to listen.\n\n\nGINGER: (O.S.) What are you? Yes, of course - He doesn't come home at night.  What is the big fuckin' deal? I go - Yes, and I just - I can't fuckin' take it. Why should I fucking take it? That wasn't the deal. He acts like... like I'm the only one around here with a fuckin' past. He'll never let me live it down.  Well... well, I mean, I tried. What the fuck do you think I came back here for? No, I'm not!\n\n\nACE slips into the foyer where he can see GINGER's reflection in a glass door as she talks on the phone in the living-room.\n\n\nGINGER: (Whispering into telephone)\n\n\nI want to have him killed. Yes, I want him killed.  I've fuckin' had it. INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT GINGER is on the phone.\n\n\nGINGER: (Into telephone) So, are you with me on this?\n\n\nACE steps up behind her. She gasps, still holding the phone. Petrified.\n\n\nACE: You want to get rid of me? Here I am. Go ahead, get rid of me (ACE grabs the phone.) Hello.\n\n\nHe hears nothing and throws the phone down near her. GINGER rises and attacks ACE.\n\n\nGINGER: (Grunting) Yes! I fuckin' hate you! I can't take it anymore!\n\n\nACE grapples with GINGER.\n\n\nGINGER: Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!\n\n\nACE: You hate my guts?

Don't worry.\n\n\nGINGER squats down and starts to gather her stuff.\n\n\nGINGER: The arrangement is over!\n\n\nACE: (Tossing clothes) No kidding. NO KIDDING!\n\n\nGINGER: And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.\n\n\nACE: I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!\n\n\nACE walks past her to his side of the large walk-in closet. Racks and racks of her clothes are still hanging.\n\n\nGINGER: Love you?!\n\n\nShe tosses a pair of red shoes at him.\n\n\nGINGER: How could I love you?! How can I love you?! You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!\n\n\nACE leans down and opens a shoe box filled with money. He grabs as much cash as he can hold.\n\n\nACE: You're lower than a dog!\n\n\nGINGER: Fuck you!\n\n\nHe walks up to her.\n\n\nACE: (Shoving the bundles of cash in her face)\n\n\nHere. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch. (Stuffing the money in her bag.) Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.\n\n\nGINGER: I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!\n\n\nShe puts on a white fur coat.\n\n\nACE: Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!\n\n\nGINGER: And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.\n\n\nShe bends down to pick up her bag, but ACE insists on carrying it.\n\n\nACE: I guarantee you, I will not stop you.\n\n\nINT. ACE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM/FOYER - NIGHT GINGER and ACE walk through their bedroom to the front door. He's carrying her suitcase.\n\n\nGINGER: Stop!

ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT, LATER ACE is lying awake in bed smoking a cigarette, watching the casino's Eye in the Sky surveillance monitors. He hears a car turn into his driveway. He sees the car's headlight beams\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) The funny thing was, that after all that... I didn't want her to go. She was the mother of my kid. I loved her. And later... I realized I didn't want to give her the money, because if I did... I knew I'd never see her again.\n\n\nACE reaches over to take GINGER's hand - she slowly takes hold of his. INT. ACE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY GINGER is getting AMY ready for school. ACE enters as AMY is on her way out. He holds her face in his hands and kisses her.\n\n\nACE: (Affectionately) Oh.

I want you to keep it on you. It's very light.  So I can call you whenever I have to.\n\n\nGINGER reluctantly takes the beeper.\n\n\nACE: (Pause.) Okay?\n\n\nShe nods silently. He looks at her and turns, leaving her alone in the kitchen. EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - EVENING A very large trailer is in the middle of an empty construction site. GINGER's and NICKY's cars are parked outside.\n\n\nNICKY: (O.S.) (From trailer) Well, what are you supposed to do? I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to stay the way you are?

That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.\n\n\nTakes a sip of his drink.\n\n\nGINGER: He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.\n\n\nNICKY: No, he wouldn't. I would have. (GINGER chuckles.) And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.

(He sighs, rubbing her neck.)\n\n\nNICKY/GINGER: (In unison) Changed.\n\n\nNICKY: He did. He ain't the same person, right?\n\n\nGINGER: (Whispering) No, he's not.\n\n\nNICKY: He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.\n\n\nGINGER: (Holding back tears) Exactly. (Sighs.) He hates me.\n\n\nShe rests her head on NICKY's shoulder, starting to weep.\n\n\nGINGER: He hates my fuckin' guts.\n\n\nNICKY: Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this. (Runs his hand down her cheek.)\n\n\nDon't cry.\n\n\nGINGER: (Crying) I'm not as tough as you think I am.\n\n\nNICKY: Yes, you are.\n\n\nGINGER: (Sobbing) I'm not and he scares the shit out of me.

You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.\n\n\nGINGER's sobs subside a little and her hand starts to stroke NICKY's neck.\n\n\nGINGER: (Whispering) I do. I need a new sponsor.\n\n\nNICKY: (Quietly, cheek to cheek)\n\n\nIs that what you want?\n\n\nGINGER: Yeah.\n\n\nNICKY: A sponsor.\n\n\nGINGER: Yeah.\n\n\nNICKY: Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.\n\n\nGINGER: (Whispering) Nicky, please...\n\n\nNICKY: Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?\n\n\nGINGER: (Sobbing) Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n\nNICKY: It's what you want?\n\n\nGINGER: Yeah. Uh-huh -\n\n\nNICKY interrupts and kisses her. She kisses him back. He pushes her head down to his lap. EXT.

You didn't answer your beeper.\n\n\nGINGER: I threw it away.\n\n\nACE: You threw it away?\n\n\nGINGER: (As she puts some items away)\n\n\nLook, I tried to do this thing.

BACK HOME RESTAURANT, STRIP MALL PARKING LOT - DAY ANDY STONE and his LAWYER are walking toward their car.\n\n\nSTONE: You call Artie... and you tell him I don't care what, he's gotta be in my office Thursday morning before eleven o'clock.\n\n\nLAWYER: It's done.\n\n\nHis LAWYER veers to the left, walking away from STONE who keeps talking.\n\n\nLAWYER: (O.S.) It's done.\n\n\nSTONE: (To himself) It's terribly important. I gotta have a conversation with this guy. That's all.\n\n\nGAGGI's men, CURLY and BEEPER, appear from behind STONE and shoot him dead. They empty their silent half-load rounds into STONE even after he's down on the snowy ground. They walk away discreetly, leaving him partially hidden between cars.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) As much as they liked him, I mean, he wasn't one of us. He wasn't Italian. As far as they knew, he could have talked. Otherwise, Stony might still be alive.\n\n\nMONTAGE OF MURDERS: EXT. NANCE'S COSTA RICAN HOUSE - DAY TITLE IN: COSTA RICA The camera moves down a waterfall to reveal NANCE's Spanish- style house.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) The first one to skip was John Nance. He found a nice, warm secluded place in Costa Rica. He thought nobody would find him there.\n\n\nSeveral gunshots are heard. NANCE emerges from the house through a door and runs along a verandah to another door. He breaks a pane of glass, unlocks another door and runs in. BEEPER emerges from the first door and follows him back into the house. Several more shots are heard. NANCE emerges from yet another door, only this time he's been shot in the stomach. He painfully staggers away from the hitmen.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) But, then, his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs, and so naturally the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hidin' just to save his kid and give 'em all up.  So...\n\n\nCURLY and BEEPER come out of the house and approach NANCE from behind.\n\n\nCURLY: Hey, where you goin', jag-off?\n\n\nNANCE kneels down. CURLY points his gun expertly at the top of NANCE's head and fires. Blood splatters from NANCE's mouth and he falls to the ground. The gunmen walk away.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) But anyway, they, you know, they all had to follow.\n\n\nEXT. HOLE IN THE DESERT - DUSK A bound COUNT ROOM EXEC and a CLERK are kneeling next to a large pit in the esert ground in front of BEEPER and CURLY.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Everybody went down.\n\n\nThe CLERK groans as he's shot in the head by BEEPER. Blood splatters and he falls right into the pre-dug hole.\n\n\nCOUNT ROOM EXEC: Go ahead, fuck...\n\n\nCURLY: Fuck you.\n\n\nCURLY shoots the EXEC in the head, he too falls backward into the pit. The gunmen fire more rounds into the bodies, then toss their guns into the hole.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Before you knew it...\n\n\nEXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT RICHIE, a sharply dressed Tangiers EXEC, is getting into his new Lincoln.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...anybody who knew anything wound up gettin' whacked.\n\n\nCURLY sneaks up from behind and hits the EXEC with a lead pipe. He puts a plastic bag over his head and begins to choke him to death. The EXEC struggles a bit but the bag soon fills with blood. CURLY strikes him with the pipe one last time. INT. BEVERLY SUNSET MOTEL - NIGHT The camera pans away from an empty registration desk to a motel corridor.\n\n\nGINGER: (O.S.) (Gasping) Oh! Oh, no!  No...\n\n\nThe camera moves past several rooms along a cinder block wall.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody. She found some pimps, low-lifes, druggies and bikers in LA. And in a few months, they went through all the money and all the jewels.\n\n\nSuddenly, a door opens and GINGER overdosing, staggers into the hall looking for help. She gasps, goes halfway down the seedy corridor towards the desk, but collapses and dies. FREEZE FRAME ON GINGER SPRAWLED OUT ON THE MOTEL CARPET.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) After they found her body... I had a private doctor do another autopsy. He said they gave her... a hot dose. In the end... all she had left was thirty-six hundred in mint-condition coins.\n\n\nEND OF MONTAGE EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY ACE emerges from the restaurant, smoking a cigarette as in the first scene in the film. He gets into his car to start the ignition.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) No matter what the Feds or the papers might have said about my car bombing...\n\n\nFlames surge from the windshield, concealing ACE behind the wheel. FLASHBACK: EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY The sign above him reads: 'Tony Roma's a Place for Ribs'. ACE is leaving the restaurant and walking to his car.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...it was amateur night, and you could tell. Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side. But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew, was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat. It's the only thing that saved my life.\n\n\nACE opens his car door and gets in. INT. ACE'S CAR, TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY ACE turns on the ignition and we see two- and three-inch flames come out of the defroster vents. Everything goes silent as he is suddenly engulfed in flames. The car explodes in flames two storeys high. The screen fills with the rising explosion of smoke and fire.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.\n\n\nEXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD - DAY NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of a car on a farm road for a meeting. FAT SALLY, a heavy-set wiseguy, is already there.\n\n\nFAT SALLY: (O.S.) Hey, Nicky.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) And so did the power that be.\n\n\nNICKY: Hey, Mikey, how's your hernia?\n\n\nThey shake hands.\n\n\nFAT SALLY: How you doin'?\n\n\nMARINO approaches NICKY from behind.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) It took months for...\n\n\nFLASHBACK: EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD - DAY NICKY's car drives up the farm road to meet his crew. NICKY: (V.O.) ...everything to calm down, but finally my guys got out on bail and the bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas.  Always the dollars, always the fuckin'... NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of the car to greet FAT SALLY. HARDY, FUSCO and BEEPER are also waiting there, smiling.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...dollars. I mean, it was still way too hot for me to even go near Vegas, so I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks. I didn't want my brother to get fucked around.\n\n\nNICKY shakes hands with SALLY. FUSCO walks up to say hello.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) I mean, what's right is right. They don't give a fuck about - urgghh!\n\n\nMARINO hits NICKY in the back with a bat. FAT SALLY grabs him by the throat. HARDY and BEEPER hold DOMINICK by the arms. MARINO hits NICKY's legs with the bat.\n\n\nFAT SALLY: Huh? Come on, you fuckin' rat.\n\n\nDOMINICK: Fuck!  You...\n\n\nFUSCO and FAT SALLY pin NICKY down and hold his face straight ahead, forcing him to watch his brother being beaten.\n\n\nDOMINICK: (To MARINO) ...rat motherfucker! You rat mother-\n\n\nMARINO hits DOMINICK in the shoulder with the bat.\n\n\nMARINO: Tough guy! You and your f- (he strikes DOMINICK's chest)\n\n\nFuckin' brother!\n\n\nDOMINICK: Oh, you - !\n\n\nNICKY tries to look away.\n\n\nMARINO: No more!\n\n\nFAT SALLY: Get him, Marino!\n\n\nMARINO: (Hitting DOMINICK across the neck)\n\n\nYou fuckin' scumbag! The wiseguys hold NICKY's face so he has to see his brother.\n\n\nMARINO: (Lunging the bat into DOMINICK's stomach)\n\n\nNo more. He swings the bat across his head, knocking DOMINICK on the ground.\n\n\nNICKY: (Still pinned, screaming)\n\n\nFrankie!\n\n\nMARINO: (Looking at NICKY as he strikes DOMINICK)\n\n\nNo more! You see? Watch! HARDY and BEEPER join MARINO. All three are beating DOMINICK with baseball bats.\n\n\nNICKY: (Held down by his neck)\n\n\nFrankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!\n\n\nMARINO: Fuck you, you motherfuck!\n\n\nThe camera tilts down to DOMINICK's bloody face as the three continue to beat him to death.\n\n\nNICKY: Fuckin' punk, motherfucker! Piece of shit!\n\n\nNICKY tries to stand up but FAT SALLY and FUSCO keep him down.\n\n\nMARINO: No more fuckin' dirty work!\n\n\nNICKY: (Rolling over on his back in pain)\n\n\nNo, no, no, no!\n\n\nMARINO: (To HARDY and BEEPER) Take him out! Take this motherfucker out!\n\n\nThey drag DOMINICK by his feet. MARINO swings at him with two bats as he's taken away into the cornfield. EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD, GRAVE SITE - DAY, A LITTLE LATER DOMINICK is battered and bloody. MARINO, HARDY and BEEPER stand over him, still swinging their bats. NICKY is on his side, still held down by SALLY and FUSCO. His face is a little bloody.\n\n\nNICKY: (Whimpering, as they beat DOMINICK)\n\n\nDominick! Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom. Frankie. (Pleading for his brother's life.) Frankie, leave the kid alone. He's still breathin'. He's still breathin'. Leave him alone. Frankie. MARINO swings two final blows to DOMINICK's head. NICKY looks away, sobbing.\n\n\nMARINO: All right. Strip him.\n\n\nMARINO and his hoods remove DOMINICK's pants and shirt.\n\n\nNICKY: (Sobbing as they undress his brother)\n\n\nNo balls, you got no fuckin' balls. Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom. NICKY sobs. They drag DOMINICK toward a freshly dug grave and toss his limp, barely conscious body into it.\n\n\nNICKY: (Crying quietly) Dominick.  Dominick. (Sobs.) Dominick.\n\n\nNICKY looks up to MARINO. They share a look before MARINO swings his bat, striking NICKY's head. FREEZE FRAME ON MARINO. UNFREEZE - LIVE ACTION CONTINUES. MARINO and his men start beating NICKY, who groans and spits blood as he is struck. EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD, GRAVE SITE - DAY, A LITTLE LATER NICKY is stripped down to his underwear. HARDY and FUSCO drag him to the grave and dump him over DOMINICK.\n\n\nMARINO: Come on, come on. Bury 'em.\n\n\nMARINO and BEEPER look on as the other hoods begin the tedious work of tossing dirt on to the bodies, shovel by shovel, until they are covered up to their necks. We see NICKY's face, bloodied and battered. He's still breathing and groaning.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) The word was out. The bosses had had enough of Nicky. They had enough. How much were they gonna take? So, they made an example of him and his brother. They buried them while they were still breathing.\n\n\nA full shovel of dirt lands upon NICKY's face and chest with a thud. INT. ACE'S CAR, TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DUSK ACE is engulfed in flames. His jacket catches fire. He opens the door and rolls out onto the pavement, barely escaping a smaller explosion. He lies on the floor as a ball of fire rises behind him. Two men pull him away from the car.\n\n\nMAN #1: Mister, you all right?\n\n\nMAN #2: Watch out, the -!\n\n\nACE watches as his car explodes in flames. Ashes and debris fall on ACE and the two men.\n\n\nMAN #2: Mister, you all right?\n\n\nACE: (Dazed) Yeah.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) They had other ideas for me.\n\n\nEXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - NIGHT ACE is being wheeled to an ambulance on a stretcher. There are firemen and policemen in the background.\n\n\nAMBULANCE DRIVER: (As ACE is wheeled into the rear of the ambulance)\n\n\nYou sure are lucky, mister. ACE's face disappears into the ambulance. FLASHBACK: EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY ACE's car explodes. Music in: J. S. Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'. EXT. THE DUNES HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT The casino is being leveled - actuality footage. EXT. THE MGM GRAND HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT The brand-new 5,000-room hotel with its entrance shaped like the MGM lion's head.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) The town will never be the same. After the...\n\n\nEXT. THE DUNES HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT The hotel and casino implodes, filling the screen with fire and smoke.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over. Today it looks like...\n\n\nINT. CASINO - DAY Slow motion of tourists walking into a casino looking like the living dead.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...Disneyland.\n\n\nINT. TREASURE ISLAND HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT A crowd gathers to watch a mock pirate ship sink in a tank.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) And while the kids play cardboard pirates, Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money...\n\n\nEXT. THE DUNES HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT The casino is destroyed floor by floor by explosions.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...on the poker slots.\n\n\nEXT. THE EXCALIBUR HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT Another 5,000 room hotel built like an Arthurian castle.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played. Today, it's like checkin' into an airport. And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.\n\n\nEXT. THE DUNES HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT The casino marquee topples to the ground in flames.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Today, it's all gone. You get a whale show up with four million in a...\n\n\nINT. CASINO - DAY The living dead walk down a few steps, marveling at the huge casino.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...suitcase, and some twenty-five- year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his Social Security Number.\n\n\nEXT. THE DUNES HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT The casino collapses into smoke and dust.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) After the Teamsters got...\n\n\nEXT. THE MIRAGE HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT A 4,000 room hotel with a 60-foot volcano out front. Tourists watch it belch smoke and flames.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...knocked out of the box, the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos. And where did the money come from...\n\n\nEXT. THE LUXOR HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT A giant glass pyramid 30 stories high with a huge sphinx outside.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...to rebuild the pyramids?... Junk bonds.\n\n\nEXT. ACE'S SAN DIEGO LUXURY HOME - DAY TITLE IN: SAN DIEGO A house very much like ACE's house in Vegas, including the fact that it backs up on a golf course. We see ACE inside talking on the phone with a bookie.\n\n\nACE: (Into telephone) Still not sure?\n\n\nINT. ACE'S SAN DIEGO LUXURY HOME - DAY An older, grayer ACE is alone in his living-room with TV sets, fax machines and multiple phone lines. He is surrounded by newspapers and files. He is very much the way we saw him during his earlier handicapping days.\n\n\nRACE ANNOUNCER: (From a television set)\n\n\nThey're off and running...\n\n\nACE: (Into telephone) Probable, but may be questionable. All right. Well, let me know as soon as you can find out.\n\n\nACE sets his cordless phone down and jots a few notes on a racing form. A television set shows a football game in the background.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) But in the end, I wound up right back where I started. I could still pick winners, and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home. And why mess up a good thing? And that's that.", "input": "Which character is $$MASK$$ ?", "answer": ["ACE", "ACE ROTHSTEIN"], "options": []}
{"id": 1, "context": "BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD Written by Lucy Alibar & Benh Zeitlin\n\n\nFINAL DRAFT: Based on the stage play \"Juicy and Delicious\" by Lucy Alibar EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAWN An abandoned looking trailer sits on top of two 15-foot-tall oil drums. Distant thunder trembles through the peeling metal panels. The structure is in such disrepair, that surely no one lives here. But then, a light goes on. INT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - MORNING A tiny hand sculpts the mud on top of a crawfish hole placed on the floor. We pan up to reveal a little girl examining a baby chicken that appears to be dead. This is HUSHPUPPY, an unkempt and seemingly uncared for six-year-old with a gaze of unmistakable wisdom. Hushpuppy places the chick on the crawfish hole, like a queen on her throne and the chick twitches to life, cheeps twice. Hushpuppy's esoteric science experiment is interrupted by DISTANT THUNDER. Her eyes stand to attention. \n\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nEXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY An eerie, harsh wind whips hay and dust through over a giant slumbering pot-belly pig. Hushpuppy, donned in boys' underpants and a child-sized wife- beater, tip-toes behind the epic creature. She studies it, wonderful, is this the source of the thunder? With the utmost delicacy, she lays a hand on the pig's belly. We hear his HUGE BEATING HEART. \n\n\nCUT TO: EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - VARIOUS A series of glimpses of Hushpuppy's scientific method. She chases geese, chickens, ducks, dogs around the property- a cross between an abandoned farm and salvage yard. Hushpuppy grabs a baby chick and puts it to her ear. A TINY HEARTBEAT. She listens with focused wonder and intensity HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) All the time, everywhere, everything's organs be beatin' and squirtin' and talkin' to each other in ways I can't understand. Mosta the time they probably just sayin' \"I'm hungry,\" or \"I gotta poop,\" but sometimes they talkin' in codes. Hushpuppy's eyes dart up as a MAN'S VOICE yells- MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Get up, get out of here! We hear a YOWL as a cat is flung across the room. A window made from a gas station sign opens in a Robinson Crusoe style tree house patched together from storm debris and discarded appliances. A wild man with severe features, a frazz of unkempt hair, and brawler's scars opens a window made from a metal sign. This is WINDELL EMMETT DOUCET, known to all as WINK .\n\n\nWINK: Get your pants on, man! Wink kills a beer and sends it out the hole in the wall into a basketball hoop attached to a fishing net that stretched 15 feet down to the ground. The net is overflowing with beer cans. EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY Hushpuppy obediently climbs a series of increasingly bigger and bigger oil drums that function like a ladder, up to the door of her house. EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY We now see Wink in his morning ritual. He opens a cooler with a butchered chicken inside it and tosses the bird on the grill. He goes to the front porch and pours down a bag of dog food. He pulls a clothesline that leads to Hushpuppy's trailer. A BELL RINGS\n\n\nWINK: Feed up time! Feed up! Hushpuppy, now wearing pants and a slightly more proper T- shirt, comes running down the oil barrels to her house. She echoes her Daddy.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Feed up time! Feed up! INT. ABANDONED BUS - DAY Hushpuppy devours the whole roast chicken with her hands, getting right in there like it was a candy apple. It looks really yummy. Pigs, dogs, chickens, and cats are chowing down all around her. A hatch opens above her and we realize we're in the bottom of the Shacko. Wink sticks his head through the hatch and throws corn to the chickens.\n\n\nWINK: Share with the dogs. Hushpuppy rips off a piece of chicken and flings it to a filthy chihuahua with no hair on the back half of its body. This is WINDELL, in spite of her circumstances, quite a handsome young pup. EXT. BATHTUB MARSH WATER - THE TURCK - EVENING WIDE, we see Hushpuppy and Wink drift through the marsh. They ride in a severed truck bed floating on top of oil drums. A motor is strapped to the back. A sign on the boat reads \"The Turck\", Hushpuppy's spelling of \"Truck\". They look out to where the water goes all the way to a monolithic, 20 foot wall stretching infinitely into the distance. This levee, the first piece of modern construction we've seen, encloses the civilized world, protecting it from rising water. The Bathtub is on the wrong side of wall. Wink stares out at the distant factories behind the wall with a peaceful and confident disdain. Hushuppy matches his relaxed defiant expression\n\n\nWINK: Ain't that ugly over there? He takes a long pull on his beer.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) We live in the prettiest place on earth. Hushpuppy looks over the wall to the Dry Side. It's an endless sprawl of oil processing power plants without a tree or bird in sight. This is the engine that runs the Northern world. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy says, up above the levee, on the dry side, they're afraid of the water like a bunch of babies. They built the wall that cuts us off. EXT. AERIAL BATHTUB - DAY We fly over marsh and water, coming upon a tiny crop of shanties on an island perched at the very bottom of the land. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They think we all gonna drown down here. But we ain't goin' nowhere. \n\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nEXT. CAUSEWAY - PRE-FLOOD - DAY CLOSE ON Hushpuppy letting out a WARRIOR SCREAM in a mass of HOLLERING people. They stand on a long and crumbling road surrounded on both sides by water. The rag tag band of revelers charge forward WHOOPING and SHOUTING. Hushpuppy kisses her hand and smacks the town sign. \"Isle de Charles Doucet\" is crossed out and someone has graffitied \"The Bathtub.\" Each party-goer repeats Hushpuppy's kiss and smack in wild, ritualistic fashion. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The Bathtub's got more holidays than the whole rest of the world EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY The townspeople charge in a rousing parade. Everyone drags trails of beer cans, boat parts, anything they can tie to themselves that makes a lot of noise. They are the hard faces of fishermen and their feisty wives, downtrodden but with a sense of fortitude among them, a community of heart, spirit, passion, and reckless abandon. We see none of the separations that we're used to in modern society. There is no evidence of politics, religion, class, race or any other divisive ideology. The Bathtub is a place of true and honest unity. Megaphones sticking out a gutted mini-van broadcast the Cajun band playing inside. Fiddle, saw, guitar, and double-bass players struggle to hold onto their instruments and the truck bounces them down a dirt road. They drive under a banner reading \"Welcome to the Bathtub Storm Season!\" Wink and Hushpuppy rattle along on a float made from the front end of a pickup truck. Over the front cabin rears a giants sculpture of a horse-head made out of wooden spikes, metal plates, and heavy chains. Carnival-dressed maniacs clamber on top. Wink hollers and waves to people. He fires jets of beer into the mouths of the crowd. Hushpuppy dances on the back of the float. Though she's the tiniest member of this very adult parade, she's right in the thick of everything. No one is checking I.Ds Here. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy always saying, that up in the dry world, they got none of what we got. EXT. LAFOURCHE SQUARE - DAY The town dances around the band in a clearing in the woods. Everyone is bouncing to the music, smiling and joking with one another. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They only got holidays once a year Six babies, each with a racing number pinned to their diaper, are placed by their enthusiastic mammas at a starting-line on a track marked by two adjacent crowds of onlookers. Bets are flying between the spectators as if they're about to watch a cock-fight. \n\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O.) All babies to the race! Come up to the starting line! The baby race is about to begin. Hushpuppy dances in the cheering crowd, swigging a bottle of something she probably shouldn't have. A STARTING GUN fires, and the babies make a crawl for it. Most of them are paralysed in tears or bewilderment, but one brave soul toddles towards victory. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They got fish stuck in plastic wrappers, they got their babies stuck in carriages, and chickens on sticks and all that kind of stuff. Hushpuppy looks up at Wink who is dancing with his best friend WALRUS , a slack jawed, white haired, pinked nosed, handsome devil. A baby crosses the finish line, ahead of the rest, victorious. The crowd goes wild. EXT. MARINA PAUPIER NET - NIGHT Wink opens his trawl net and dumps a massive catch into a picking pan. There's food to feed a hundred in the haul. No one is a bit fazed though, this is just your average night fishing in the Bathtub. Shrimp, crabs, and small leaping fish struggle over one another for dear life. Hushpuppy helps him sort the catch. Winks's hands move with virtuosic ease, separating the crabs from the shrimp. She studies Wink's every move and tries to measure up to her Dad's proficiency. He doesn't demonstrate or explain anything, but we sense there is a system of education in place here Hushpuppy focuses in on a tiny fish, wriggling and sucking it's last breaths of air. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) One day, the storm's gonna blow, the ground's gonna sink, and the water's gonna rise up so high, there ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a whole bunch of water. She pick up a crab, pets its belly. The DIN of the party fades down around her as she listens to its HEARTBEAT. EXT. LADY JO'S CYPRESS FOREST - NIGHT Explosions everywhere as Bathtubers rampage blasting fireworks down the street instead of into the air. Men dressed as women, women dressed as men, in some kind of reckless esoteric ritual. The SCORE kicks in hard with a tinge of ominous forboding. We sense that in spite of the ecstatic energy, the unbridled joy, that a cloud hangs over this community. The people are parting like it's there last day on earth, and we feel viscerally, that it could be. Hushpuppy runs in the thick of it behind Wink waving a fountain sparkler. Wink trips and falls. Wink lies on his back on the ground. He sees his daughter watching him, holding the huge sparkler, and they both laugh with sheer joy. Hushpuppy stops over him and points a bottle rocket in his face, the fuse burning. He nods his approval. They watch the fuse burn down to the last moment. She turns it upward, and they watch her rocket join a sky filled with pluming mortars. Hushpuppy looks at the light flickering across Wink's faces. He's momentarily peaceful, admiring the spectacular display. Hushpuppy smiles at him with pride. He doesn't see her. They run off into the crowd, which is pulsating at the pinnacle of mayhem. The OMINOUS MUSIC shifts gears into a BLASTING PATRIOTIC HYMN of the Bathtub. Throw your fist in the air! These are the survivors, those who fight for their joy and their history to the last man. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) But me and my Daddy, we stay right here. We who the earth is for. Hushpuppy runs right at us with detonating fireworks in both hands, engulfed by light. She swings them toward camera and the screen is engulfed in an inferno of sparks. A white out. Black letters slam down. BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD INT. SCHOOLBOAT - MORNING MUSIC CUTS abruptly as a basket of crawfish is slammed in front of camera. The crawfish squirming and struggling for life engulfs the screen.\n\n\nWOMAN'S VOICE: Meat. A fearsome, uncompromising leader, sexy like a lady bullfighter, peeks at Hushpuppy over a mass of squirming crawfish. This is MISS BATHSHEBA . She points to three students, pushing their heads with her finger, each time announcing:\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: MEAT. MEAT. MEAT. The twelve students follow her through a maze of creatures caged in mason jars, basins, and boxes with breathing holes- her educational tools. MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Every animal is made out of meat. I am meat, ya'll asses meat. Everything is part of the buffet of the universe. Miss Bathsheba rolls up the leg of her skirt. MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) This here, is an Aurochs. Riding her thigh, is tattooed a scene much like a cave painting in Lascaux. In thick black ink, it depicts a battle between early men wielding spears, and giant bull-like animals bearing down over them\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) A fierce, mean creature that roamed the earth back when we all lived in caves. They would gobble the cave- babies down right in front of their cave-parents. And the cavemen couldn't do nothing about it, because they were too poor, too stupid, too small. Who here thinks the Cavemen were sitting around crying like a buncha pussies? Children stare blankly, no one raises their hand. Hushpuppy watches a heroic crawfish crest the basket, fall to the floor, and make a run for it. Miss Bathsheba snatches up the rogue crawdad and flings it back into the vat. \n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Y'all better think about that. Cause any day now, the fabric of the universe is coming unraveled. The ice caps gonna melt, the water's gonna rise, and everything south of the levee's going under. She points to a map showing a ragged coastline. On the wrong side of a giant line marked \"levee\" is an island labeled \"The Bathtub.\" \n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a whole bunch of water. Y'all better learn to survive. A mysterious COLD WIND fills the air. Hushpuppy stares into a wall poster of an ice cliff reading: THE SOUTH POLE. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Way back in the day, the Aurochs was king of the world. EXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF - DAY CRASH CUT to the PANORAMA of an ice cliff, but now it's real We CUT CLOSER to overwhelming white light accompanied by intermittent FROZEN CRACKS that build in frequency and volume. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) If it wasn't for giant snowballs, and the iced age. I wouldn't even be Hushpuppy, I would just be breakfast. The light dims in intensity to reveal, frozen deep inside the ice wall, barely visible- a fanged, hairy, bloated, stone aged creature, the same as on Miss Bathsheba's leg. This is an Aurochs. INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - EVENING Hushpuppy climbs a metal ladder made from a railing, up to Wink's shanty in the trees. Windell, her dirty Chihuahua, follows behind.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Daddy? Feed-up time. Feed-up? Hushpuppy bangs on the door of the shacko.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) Daddy? Nothing. She goes inside. The house is empty. She checks the Shacko for food. Nothing. EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - EVENING Several hours later, Hushpuppy stands on a metal bin looking into the distance.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: DADDY!? Like some sort of animal call, she SHRIEKS\n\n\nINT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - NIGHT Hushpuppy draws a picture of Wink on a foldout mattress... HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Kids that got no Mamma, no Daddy and nobody. They got to live in the woods, and eat grass, and steal underpants. Hushpuppy lays down next to her drawing of Wink. EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - MORNING Windell, the Chihuahua and the potbelly pig awake to greet the day. Hushpuppy peers into the ground floor of the shacko.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Daddy? Daddy? No response. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) (CONT'D) If Daddy don't get home soon, it's gonna be time for me to start eating my pets. EXT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY Kids walk home with their parents after a day at the Schoolboat, which we now see is big a yellow houseboat floating on the bayou. Hushpuppy waits alone, no one has come to get her. Miss Bathsheba locks up the door and heads for her small motor boat tied off on the side of the school.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: You need a ride, boo?\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: My Daddy's coming to pick me up.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: How about food or something, you hungry? 12\n\n\nHushpuppy shakes her head `no'. Miss Bathsheba's doesn't totally believe her, but she's not the type to coddle either. \n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Alright, well suit yourself. Miss Bathsheba motors away. Hushpuppy waits until she's out of sight and starts walking. INT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - MORNING Playing don't-touch-the-floor, Hushpuppy navigates her house. The room has with holes in the walls blocked with old clothes and paper towels. Homemade toys fill every surface. This is the domain of a child at loose ends. Hushpuppy leaps over her bed- a nook piled with clothes- and plugs in the Christmas lights. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O) Everything we still got from Mamma, we keep in my house. We push in on a shrine to her mother: A red basketball jersey. An apron. A sawed-off shotgun. A child's drawing of a beautiful lady. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Daddy says, the first time she looked at me, it made her heart beat so big, that she thought it would blow up. That's why she swam away. Hushpuppy takes the jersey down. She puts it over a chair in the dining area. Hushpuppy gets a can of cat food. A pot. Water in a bowl. Her actions have a sad sense of routine to them- she's been left alone before, and has her own self-invented system for feeding herself. She opens a can of cat food, takes it out with her hand and throws it in a pot. She licks the remnants off her finger.\n\n\nMARIETTA'S VOICE: Hi my sweet baby.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Hi momma. MARIETTA, Hushpuppy's imaginary, invisible mamma, is speaking from the basketball jersey chair. Marietta functions like an imaginary friend- Hushpuppy is the only one who can see her. Hushpuppy takes the pot, puts it on the stove.\n\n\nMARIETTA'S VOICE: Hushpuppy what you doing there? You being good like I taught you?\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Yes, mamma. Hushpuppy turns on the gas. Hushpuppy goes through her safety precautions: oven mitts, a helmet, she flips the table and hides behind it. She aims the stove lighter: a flame thrower made from a cigarette lighter and a can of spray deodorant. A spray of flames ignites the stove in a FIREBALL. \n\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nMOMENTS LATER. Hushpuppy behind the bubbling stove. She ties on an apron and sways to the music. She is dressing like her mom. Marietta's Voice sings to her.\n\n\nMARIETTA'S VOICE: You're good, you make me happy / you're good, you make me happy.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: That's pretty Mamma.\n\n\nMARIETTA'S VOICE: You're pretty Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy stares into the floating islands of cat food frying in fat, which in her POV is a surreal churning vision, like the bubbling lava at the center of the earth. She's SHOCKED out of her vision by a YOWLING CAT being flung across the yard.\n\n\nWINK (O.S) Get out of my way you fat animal! Hushpuppy jumps down from the stove, grabs a bowl of water, and runs to greet Wink, EXT. WINK'S COMPOUND - MORNING She clambers down the oil drum ladder spilling her water everywhere in her excitement.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Daddy! Daddy, Daddy! Wink doesn't turn to acknowledge her as he trudges across the field toward his Shacko. He's wearing a hospital patient's smock and no shoes, it seems he checked himself out.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) I learned lots of stuff while you gone. If I drink all this here I can burp like a man. Hushpuppy gulps down water, all of it. Wink keeps walking. Hushpuppy BURPS like a man, but he doesn't turn around. Hushpuppy stops to examine the situation. Something's not right here.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) How come you wearing a dress? Hushpuppy tugs his patient's smock and he shrugs her off violently.\n\n\nWINK: Leave me alone, Man. She sees his hospital I.D bracelet still on.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: You wearing a bracelet too?\n\n\nWINK: Go in your house, you wouldn't understand.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I wanna come in your house\n\n\nHushpuppy whacks Wink's butt.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) I WANNA COME IN YOUR HOUSE! Wink fakes like he's gonna smack her.\n\n\nWINK: GO AHEAD! Hushpuppy tears off. Wink storms into the Shacko in the Backo. INT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY Hushpuppy stomps inside. Her cat food is burning, with steam jetting up to the ceiling. She thinks about it for a moment, and turns the burner up. Smoke billows. Hushpuppy grabs her basketball jersey off the chair and jumps over the breakfront counter. Behind her A MASSIVE GREASE EXPLOSION. Hushpuppy ducks down, panicking. She check over the median. The stove is on engulfed in flames. Hushpuppy scrambles under a cardboard box. INT./EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S BOX - DAY The walls of the box are decorated with years of her drawings. In here she feels a strange safety. The FLAMES and BREAKING WINDOWS feel distant and muffled. She draws a hieroglyphic of herself sad and crying on an island with a sun and a palm tree. She peeks out as Wink runs into the house, which is filled with black smoke, flickering flames.\n\n\nWINK (O.S.) (panicking from inside) Hushpuppy!? Boss lady!? Hushpuppy where you at!? Hushpuppy drops the box closed. Smoke billows into the box, filling it up\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O) If Daddy kill me, I ain't gonna be forgotten, I'm recording my story for the scientists of the future. Hushpuppy draws a bigger figure giving her a hug as Wink's panicked fury intensifies outside.\n\n\n WINK (O.S) HUSHPUPPY!? Where are you Boss!? HUSHPUPPY (V.O) In a million years, when kids go to school, they gonna know that once there was Hushpuppy and she lived with her Daddy in the Bathtub. Wink pulls Hushpuppy's drawings off the walls, he flings them out the door to safety. Hushpuppy coughs. Wink has heard. He looks toward the box.\n\n\nWINK: BOSS LADY? Hushpuppy and makes a runs for it, flying out the door.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Don't you run away from me. I swear to GOD Hushpuppy! EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY Hushpuppy runs out of Wink's compound into the woods, Wink on her trail. In the background, the house is a towering inferno. EXT. TRAIL BEHIND WINK'S COMPOUND - DAY They run deeper into the swamp.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I'm tearing off!\n\n\nWINK: You ain't tearing off nothin', I'll bust your ass! 17\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I'm tearing off just like my Momma.\n\n\nWINK: Come on! Wink tried to yank her toward home and Hushpuppy refuses. She digs her heels in.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) See what happens. See what happens to you! Hushpuppy hooks her leg around a tree and holds on. Wink slaps Hushpuppy and she falls face down. He looks away, disgusted with himself.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) See what you making me do? You're killing me! He reaches down and tries to pick her up.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Get up and now come on. Hushpuppy jumps up on her own.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I hope you do die! And after you die, I come to your grave and eat birthday cake all by myself! Hushpuppy punches Wink in the heart and suddenly EVERYTHING GOES QUIET, as if all the insects in the forest have hushed. All at once, we hear-- A HUMAN HEART, beating until there is a SONIC BOOM, an earsplitting CRACK of glacial ice. Hushpuppy turns toward the sound. When she turns back Wink's face has transformed, wrenches with fear and pain. Wink keels over clutching his arm. Hushpuppy stares, her breath accelerating. Wink's eyes roll back in his head, he begins to seizure\n\n\nANOTHER GLACIAL CRACK rings out. The SPLITTING builds to a DEAFENING ROAR. She covers her ears. EXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF / WOODS - DAY Fissures appear like lightning through the massive ice cliff from the opening of the movie. Hushpuppy runs from the sound, hands over her ears. We INTERCUT with shots of falling glaciers. The universe is coming unravelled. An ice shelf COLLAPSES into the ocean in a MASSIVE AVALANCHE, a wave rolls toward camera. EXT. GRAVEYARD BY THE WATER - DAY The wave, now just a tiny ripple, hits Hushpuppy's feet. Suddenly, the water level rises around her. It overtakes her knees and keeps going. Hushpuppy backs up to shore, terrified. Hushpuppy calls out to a distant beacon flashing on the horizon.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Momma!? Momma!? MOMMA!? I think I broke something. EXT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY Hushpuppy runs out of the woods toward school in a total panic. In front of the school parents pile their children into a pickup trucks and vans.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Miss Bathsheba! Miss Bathsheba! My Daddy fell down! Miss Bathsheba takes Hushpuppy's hands as she tries to catch her breath to speak. Clutched in her hand is the hospital bracelet that Wink had been wearing. Bathsheba turns over the diagnostic bracelet and reads it, her eyes widen in recognition and alarm\n\n\nINT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY Hushpuppy watches Miss Bathsheba frantically pull herbs and roots from her containers of medicinal oddities and pack it into a large medicine jar.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: It's gonna be OK baby. Bathsheba hands Hushpuppy the medicine jar. MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Ok, Hushpuppy, here's what I need you to do. You take this medicine and run as fast as you can. Go! EXT. SWAMP CLEARING - DAY We see glimpses of nature protecting itself from the impending disaster. Flowers curl up, insects horde food underground, RUSTLING sounds fill the air. Black birds, and bats, and all manner of flying creatures fill the sky. They're all getting the hell out of dodge. Hushpuppy, quaking with fear, runs through a menacing swamp clutching her medicine jar. The rising winds swirl the marsh grass all around her. Hushpuppy runs to the spot where Wink collapsed. He's gone. Hushpuppy looks around the swamp, unable to understand. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy could have turned into a tree, or a bug. There wasn't any way to know. Hushpuppy hides her medicine jar in her storage unit- a leather flap laid over the hollow of an oak tree. The hollow is filled with trinkets and objects she's collected over the years. Hushpuppy flinches as a shrieking animal calls out. She looks up to see a leaf covered in writhing caterpillars. One of them has been skewered by a beetle and is fighting for it's life\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The whole universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If one piece busts, even the smallest piece, the entire universe will get busted. EXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF - DAY Blocks of glaciers roll out of the avalanche and away from Antarctica like floating ice cubes. Embedded in each cube, is an Aurochs. A single ice cube takes over the frame and the mammoth dead Aurochs' eye stares right at us. Its jaw wide, its fangs bared, the ferocious beast appears to have fossilized mid- pounce. THUNDER BOOMS. We drift upwards into the cloud cover. As we rise above the white canopy, the spiral of a hurricane forms. EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY STRINGS SWELL under HOWLING WINDS. We follow behind a little boy running down the road with an alarm bell as the people of the Bathtub mobilize in a frenzied evacuation.\n\n\nBOY: The storm's coming! The storm's coming! EXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY Hushpuppy sulks out of the woods, feeling sorry for herself. She looks up and freezes like she's seen a ghost. Wink hobbles down the road, looking shell-shocked. The traffic on the road moves in one direction: out. Wink walks back into town in the opposite direction. In Hushpuppy's POV Wink arrives at Lady Jo's bar where a band of drunken sweethearts are in their regular positions. They are watching the evacuation go by like it's a Veteran's Day parade. They giggle and hurl good-natured curses out to a family making their way to safety\n\n\nLITTLE JO: Look at these assholes running around all over the damn place. C'est la vie assholes!\n\n\nWINK: I know y'all with me. Y'all doin' the storm.\n\n\nLITTLE JO: Lady Jo's ain't never closed honey.\n\n\nWINK: That's what I'm talking about. Walrus my big man, you staying?\n\n\nWALRUS: Wrong number buddy. I'm outta here as soon as I finish my beer. Wink dismisses him with a wave of his hand.\n\n\nWINK: You ain't goin nowhere.\n\n\nWALRUS: This ain't no sneeze comin' out the gulf. I'm gone brother.\n\n\nWINK: I'll see you tomorrow Walrus. Lookit there, Winston's with me. WINSTON is passed out on the stairs.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) What you doing about the storm Winston? Without opening his eyes, Winston raises an umbrella over his head. Wink laughs.\n\n\nWALRUS: Hey! It's Hushpuppy.\n\n\nEVERYBODY: Hushpuppy! Hushpuppy's here. They burst into a round of drunken applause\n\n\nWINK: Hushpuppy? Where you been?\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: What happened to y-\n\n\nWINK: Shut-up! He lifts her up by the britches and carries her away.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) You don't talk! INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - GROUND FLOOR - DAY Through the bus window, Hushpuppy watches Wink prepare for the storm as branches and debris fly by him. He RANTS to himself and drinks. He ties the Turck onto the house. Hushpuppy looks to where her animals lurch and freeze, run around in circles, pant heavily. They feel it coming. Rain drops start to spatter the window and Wink trips and falls trying to catch a fleeing chicken. INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - 2ND FLOOR - NIGHT Now, the full force of the storm HOWLS and CLATTERS the shutters. Rain screams against the corrugated metal roof. Wink tapes padding over all sharp corners and plastic wraps the furniture. He's Hushpuppy-proofing everything. He runs a piece of duct tape across the floor.\n\n\nWINK: This side is still Wink's house. No toys, and no girl stuff over here. Wink pushes charred toys from Hushpuppy's house across the line.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) So if I want to come over that side and smack you in the face, that's against the rules. So there's a plus for you\n\n\nHushpuppy is not able to see the bright side here.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Now come on down here and get in the boat, man. He points to a trunk on the floor. Hushpuppy hops down and gets in. Wink sits on his air mattress.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) If the water get real high, we gonna float to the top and we gonna bust through the roof and we gonna ride away, okay? Wink puts a pair of mismatching water wings on her.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) You never NEVER take these off. I'm your Daddy, and you do what I tell you to do, because it's my job to keep you from dying, ok? So sit back and just listen to me... Close your eyes and go to sleep. CLOSE YOUR EYES! Hushpuppy watches Wink pretending to sleep. The THUNDER scares the bejesus out of him again. She looks to the ceiling where water is starting to pour in steadily. Looks back at Wink who is sneaking a sip from his liquor bottle. He resumes his phony sleep. A strong gust of wind JOLTS the entire room and he springs out of bed.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Why you starin' at me like that? I can't sleep with you starin' at me like that. Wink paces the floor.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Listen. You need to understand, you're a kid and I'm a man. She doesn't understand\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) What, you scared? Hushpuppy nods. THUNDER BOOMS and Wink is the one who flinches.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Don't be scared, no storm can't beat no Doucet. I'm gonna show you. You watch. But he can see she's still scared.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) I'm'll show you! We Doucets we're not scared of no damn storm. Wink grabs a bottle of moonshine and climbs down the hatch in the floor into the storm. Hushpuppy runs to the window and peeks out. OUTSIDE. The frenzy of the hurricane propels Wink at full sprint through the 100 MPH winds. He tears his clothes off and guzzles moonshine as branches fall all around him.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Look at me! Look at me Hushpuppy! Watch me kick butt. Wink fires his shotgun at the heavens.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Hell yea! I'm right here! I'm right here I ain't going nowhere. AHHHHHH!!! A THUNDER CLAP shakes the house so hard a ceiling beam CRASHES down. Hushpuppy runs to her bed as if it might keep her safe. Windell, swinging from a basket tied to the ceiling, BARKS, panicking herself.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Mamma!? MAMMA!? \n\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n25 EXT. PATAGONIAN COAST - NIGHT Still in the rainstorm, a glacial cube SHATTERS, flopping a mammoth body onto the shoreline. It's chest heaves and a LOW SNORT is heard. The animal begins to roll over. Her dinosaur size hoof plants in the mud as she lifts herself up. We stare over the muscular haunch of her body as she stares into the distance. The massive creature turns, testing her limbs after thousands of years of sleep. She looks up to the storm and lets loose a GURGLING ROAR. We sit close on one of her black eyes. There is something dangerously sad in her cold gaze. Her head moves from the frame as she starts forward on her journey. EXT. AERIAL BATHTUB - DAY Silence. The storm has passed. The camera flies high over the Bathtub. The tops of houses poke out from the massive water like lily-pads in a pond. EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - FLOODED - MORNING A slab of metal stares at us, surrounded by water. Something under the metal BANGS TWICE and an axe dislodges a roof panel. The axe twists and leverages off the slab. Wink hefts Hushpuppy on top of the roof. Then Windell. Dishevelled and hung-over, he pulls himself up too. The three survivors stare in stunned silence at their new world. EXT. FLOODED LAFOURCHE ROAD - TURCK - MORNING Wink slowly navigates the Turck in through the flooded landscape where their town had once been. Neither he nor Hushpuppy can say a word. Everything is submerged. Every organism is dead or has fled. The quiet is overwhelming HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) For every animal that didn't have a Dad to put it in a boat, the end of the world already happened. They're all down below, trying to breathe through water. They pass abandoned house, after abandoned house, the ones on stilts have water up to the porches. Trees are bashed through roofs, walls are blown through, bathrooms exposed. EXT. WINSTON'S HOUSE - FLOODED - MORNING Wink uses a pole to open a door.\n\n\nWINK: Yo Winston? No one answers. They push off. EXT. EDISON'S HOUSE - FLOODED - THE TURCK - DAY Wink enters an intact house with water up to the porch. WINK (O.S.) Edison? Ow-Wee! Wink leans against the door frame. From his POV we see Hushpuppy on the Turck. She picks a leaf and eats it. Wink shakes his head in dismay, realizing all too clearly his girl is not ready for survival. EXT. SWAMP - THE TURCK - DAY The Turck passes through a net of Spanish moss into the belly of a swamp.\n\n\nWINK: Some day when I'm gone, you gonna be the last man in the bathtub. You have to learn how to feed your house. Wink goes to the edge of the turck and sticks his hand in the water\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Now, stick your left hand in this water, stick it in there. Hushpuppy puts her right hand in the water.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Ok, what you do is you hold your hand steady and you just wait for your fish to come. You gotta ball your fist up, this is your punching hand. Ball your fist up in case you have to whack it when they come up. Wink pulls a Catfish out with his bare hand.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) WHOOOOO YEA! Whooo lord, look what we got. I gotcha. Say \"I gotcha!\"\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I gotcha! Wink slams the fish down on the floor of the Turck and pins it.\n\n\nWINK: Yea! Hold him down! Now, you hold it down like this, and whack him good with your fist. Wink pins the fish and punches it in the face.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Go ahead whack him! You whack him good. Hold him like that and whack him! Hushpuppy pins the fish. She tries to whack it and it cuts her.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: OW! She hides her cut hand from Wink.\n\n\nWINK: You OK? That's all a part of it\n\n\nHushpuppy winces in pain.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) You wanna try it again? Hushpuppy shakes her head no, trying not to cry.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Come on. One more time. INT. EDISON'S HOUSE - FLOODED - NIGHT Hushpuppy has enclosed herself under a table with a tablecloth on it. She's drawing on the floor with charcoal. Something alive hits the roof and scurries across. We hear the entire house MOAN, or was it a distant ROAR?\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Daddy? Wink's hacking cough, which has gotten worse since last we heard it, fills the room. Hushpuppy tries to shake him awake. Hushpuppy looks through the gap in his shirt. On Wink's chest, surrounding his heart, a corroded spider web of purple bruises shows through the skin, like varicose veins covering his entire heart. Hushpuppy's eyes go wide with horror. EXT. EDISON'S HOUSE - NIGHT The beacon pulses on the distant horizon.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Mamma? Is that you? The beacon does not respond.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) I've broken everything\n\n\nEXT. DESERT - DAY A cloud of dust circulates particles. The Haze is blinding. A distant RUMBLING grows. Dark shapes tear through the haze in a deafening stampede. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Strong animals, they know when your hearts are weak. That makes them hungry and they start coming. We see one at first, then more join rank around it. The Aurochs are charging in a pack. They are a biblical terror; the horsemen of the apocalypse. EXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY The turck moves through the cypress forest, signs are strewn everywhere pointing to Lady Jo's bar. It appears abandoned. Suddenly, the door SQUEAKS open. Walrus winces at the sunlight and pops a beer. He steps out the door and SPLASHES into the water.\n\n\nWALRUS: Holy bowlegged Sarah!\n\n\nWINK: Hey partner! Hey Walrus! Wink pulls in the Turck and paddles to rescue the thrashing drunkard. They leverage Walrus aboard and lay him out on deck.\n\n\nWALRUS: (gauging his surroundings) I musta passed out. Wink starts chuckling silently. His chuckle builds to a laugh. INT. LADY JO'S BAR - FLOODED - DAY They enter the bar, empty bottles, half eaten crabs, and general party debris are littered everywhere\n\n\nLittle Jo is sprawled on the floor under a table. Is she dead or just wasted?\n\n\nWINK: Little Jo! She awakes with a start and bangs her head on the table.\n\n\nLITTLE JO: Wink!? Wink and Walrus run to help her up. LITTLE JO (CONT'D) (TO WALRUS) You don't touch me you filthy bastard! (TO WINK) Wink, you get me. They both lift her. LITTLE JO (CONT'D) Goin' on all night `bout how tonight's the last night on earth we gotta make it count. Talkin' dirty right in front of Peter T.\n\n\nWALRUS: Sorry Peter T. Peter T enters from the Bathroom.\n\n\nWINK: Peter T, my man! I knew you wasn't gonna leave me man! Peter T speaks in his polite, level-headed, soft sweet voice.\n\n\nPETER T: Oh no, oh no.\n\n\nWALRUS: (re: Peter T) That is one classic dude right there.\n\n\nWINK: Peter T, you are a titan! Glad you stayed man! RHHAAAA! 31\n\n\nWink jiggles Peter T's ample belly. Peter T giggles with glee. Wink puts one arm around Walrus and the other around Peter T. He smiles to Hushpuppy. She laughs too, the first smile in quite some days. INT. LADY JO'S BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT The Bathtub crew are lolling in the later party stages. There is a rooster on the table looking like the most sober creature in the room by far.\n\n\nWALRUS: If I had wings, I know I could have flown in that bad boy. But I would have probably bounced off a tree, or... Hushpuppy lays on the table in pile of empty crab shells.\n\n\nWINK: Hushpuppy! Did I ever tell you the story of your conception? The bar crowd chuckles.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) When me and Hushpuppy's Mamma first met we was so shy, we used to sit around, and drink beer, and smile at each other. One day we was so shy we just napped... Wink's voice FADES DOWN as Hushpuppy's fantasy takes over. She closes her eyes. EXT. FANTASY HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY Wink, younger and prettier, naps in an uncharacteristically colorful lawn chair. A LOW, GURGLING GROWL wakes him up. There in the yard, crawling slow and lazy, is a massive 15- foot alligator, breathing the heavy, slutty way alligators breathe\n\n\nA topless woman steps in front. Sweat beading on her perfect shoulder blades, down her perfect, back ending in a pair of boys' underpants- just like Hushpuppy's. Throughout Hushpuppy's vision, we never see Marietta's face, it's always covered, shot from the back, or out of frame. Marietta cocks the shotgun with one hand, Terminator 2 style. Lowers it on the gator... BLAM. Wink sits up in SLOW MOTION- her panties, and her long naked legs are covered with gator blood. She turns to Wink, her head ABOVE FRAME. CLOSE UP on her eye. She winks. INT. FANTASY HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - NIGHT We follow behind Marietta's supple curves as she walks into the kitchen. Her white slip is almost see through...almost. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Back when Daddy used to talk about Mamma, he'd say she was so pretty she never even had to turn on the stove. She runs her fingers along the counter and the burners IGNITE one by one as she passes. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) She just walk into a room and water start to boil. Water starts to bubbles like a spontaneous volcanic eruption. Marietta reaches into the frigidaire, and pulls out two ice- cold beers. Ice melts down the bottles. She opens them on the counter, flawlessly. She walks over to Wink. Stands there. A hot mess. Wink's voice FADES UP WINK (V.O.) Your Momma battered that gator up, and set it to fry. \n\n\nCUT TO: INT. LADY JO'S BAR - NIGHT Wink tips his drink.\n\n\nWINK: ...and Hushpuppy popped into the universe maybe four minutes later. He empties the glass, sufficiently drunk now.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) I got it under control. Wink looks away, lost in his own fantasy. INT. FANTASY HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - NIGHT Over Marietta's shoulder, beads of sweat form along the strap of her slip. Good Lord. Wink looks, and meets her eyes. The gaze of a proud and smitten man. Grits fall through the chimney vent, into the boiling water. Dancing like all the invisible particles of the universe. INT. LADY JO'S BAR - NIGHT Hushpuppy stares hard, her face locked in pride and determination. Filling with all the strength and heroism of her long-lost mother. She's ready to snap into action. EXT. FLOODED BATHTUB - THE TURCK - DAY ENERGETIC MUSIC drops and we move in a semi-montage through Hushpuppy's search for survivors. Hushpuppy rows the Turck through the flooded Bathtub by herself. In the distance she sees a lone horse. It stands on an tiny island of land, the last high ground in an endless stretch of water\n\n\nThe horse holds Hushpuppy's gaze. She hears it's strong, resilient HEARTBEAT. They are one and the same. EXT. SCHOOLBOAT - THE TURCK - DAY Hushpuppy approaches Schoolboat, which has weathered the storm relatively intact.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Miss Bathsheba!? INT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY Hushpuppy opens the door. We hear RUSTLING and WHISPERING inside school. It's three little girls left behind in the storm. JOY STRONG, a tall, wild-haired leader; LIZARD, a tiny thing in a giant man's tee shirt, and T-LOU, the muscle of this girl gang, looking very meek in her desperate condition. The girls are huddled against each other, terrified, hungry, and alone. EXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY Miss Bathsheba, shell-shocked but steadfast, steers the boat toward the bar, the four girls now safely in her care. From the inside we hear CAROUSING, TOASTING, and RAUCOUS CAJUN MUSIC. INT. LADY JO'S BAR - FLOODED - NIGHT Wink pours a mountain of crab and shrimp at a great communal table, assembled from many different tables.\n\n\nWINK: Come on lets go! Time to eat! Come on children, feed up time! He sends a feast sliding across the floor under the table, where Joy, T-Lou, and Lizard dig in. Wink has decorated the bar with all the waterlogged relics of the Bathtub\n\n\nThe room is a shrine of people's chairs, umbrellas, clothing. We're late in the game, and the party has descended into utter debauchery. Jean raises a glass.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: To the last of the food!\n\n\nWALRUS: To the last of the water!\n\n\nLITTLE JO: You ain't drinkin' no water. Miss Bathsheba pour shots and toasts.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Yea, tastes like more, alright! Hushpuppy struggles to peel her shrimps, sitting on top of the table. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) For the ones we'd never find, we make a funeral the Bathtub way, with no crying allowed. Drunken Wink is giving drunken Walrus a bath as he eats.\n\n\nWALRUS: When the water goes down, I'm gonna French kiss the dirt!\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Water's not goin' down man.\n\n\nWINK: Nah, that's my beautiful place under there.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Man you know they got plenty of salt coming into that water, everything beautiful is gone. Trees are gonna dies first, then the animals, then the fish.\n\n\nWINK: I got it under control\n\n\nHushpuppy picks up a crab. She tries to pound it open, tries yanking on a leg. She can't shell it.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: Come on Hushpuppy, come over here lemme show you how. Hushpuppy sits down next to Jean, a good pupil. JEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D) Here baby. You hold like this, then you turn it over like that. Hushpuppy follows instruction in deep concentration, but a bit tentative. We see Wink look away from Walrus and Jo's bawdy humor extravaganza and focus in on Hushpuppy. His disdain is palpable for this froufrou shelling technique. JEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D) Don't be scared of it now. Now, you take this knife, and you pop this off. Jean holds Hushpuppy's hand and guides a knife to open the belly of the crab. JEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D) Atta girl.\n\n\nWINK: NO! Hushpuppy-- Wink POUNDS the table. And the party falls suddenly silent. Wink pushes the utensil away. He grabs a crab, opens it in three virtuosic hand motions. Grease and spice explode everywhere and Wink sucks the face of the crab clean. It is beautiful to watch. He slams a fresh crab in front of Hushpuppy.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Beast it! Hushpuppy looks to Miss Bathsheba for guidance.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: You heard your Daddy. Beast it\n\n\nHushpuppy pulls on the crab shell with all her might. She doesn't have the power.\n\n\nEVERYONE: (CLAPPING ALONG) BEAST IT! BEAST IT! BEAST IT! The kids jump out from under the table and chant. Hushpuppy is turning blue, her eyes bulge with effort... CRACK! Hushpuppy opens the crab claw and sucks down the meat. Everyone goes wild with applause! The kids too! Hushpuppy stands up, ascending to the top of the table. She lets loose a WARRIOR CRY and flexes her muscles, deadly triumphant. Little Jo gets so excited she starts dancing on the table. She CACKLES and jitterbugs wildly. Walrus gets up to join her. Jean gets up and dances too. All the kids get up. Wink glows with pride. Miss Bathsheba smiles.\n\n\nWINK: Yea! You see what kinda family we got?! We got feeling! EXT. SCHOOLBOAT - FLOODED - VARIOUS A DRIVING SCORE kicks in as we MONTAGE through the transformation of the Schoolboat into a ramshackle Ark. \n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) It wasn't no time to sit around crying like a bunch of pussies. The survivors whittle sticks into spears, bend metal debris into spikes. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) We was gonna build a camp right on top of the Bathtub\n\n\nJean Battiste, cackling wildly, hauls a thrashing goat onto a floating animal pen. Chicken coops, snake cages, a pig pen are stacking precariously.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: We got enough animals to eat until the water goes down. Rafts are lashed to the sides of the school. Every floating structure left in town is hauled in and added to the Ark. Peter T ties on a floating vegetable garden. In WIDE we see what looks like a small village of floating structures forming. \n\n\nINT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY Miss Bathsheba puts Lizard's head in her lap, Lizard is playing as if she's unconscious after hyperventilating.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: (teaching a lesson) Come here, like this. She takes Hushpuppy's hand and places it on Lizard's chest. She moves her hand in a circular motion. \n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Like this. Tee-Lou get some water. Tee-Lou runs to get a handful of water. \n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Quick little circles. Good for the heart. Joy Strong? Joy turns her back. Miss Bathsheba shakes her head. Tee-Lou returns and pours water on Lizard's head, cooling her. MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) This is most important thing I can ever teach y'all. You got to take care of people that's smaller and sweeter than you are. Hushpuppy registers this advice, takes it to heart. She rubs Lizard's chest with delicacy and affection\n\n\nLizard's breathing returns to normal, and she sits up peacefully. Hushpuppy is awestruck. Bathsheba gets to her feet. \n\nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)  That's better. \n\nINT. SCHOOLHOUSE - NIGHT Hushpuppy watches Wink sleeping. His breathing has gotten worse. She tiptoes up with her red basketball jersey and lays it down on Wink, tucking him in just right. A DISTANT RUMBLING is heard. Cutting off suddenly as we... \n\n\nCUT TO: EXT. BRAZILIAN FAVELLAS - DAY A quiet town, not unlike the Bathtub, but with tangled power- lines, electrical towers, and layered hills. A stone flies from behind a house and bounces down the street, denting the silence. Slowly, the peaceful morning transitions into MORE RUMBLING, a distant CRACK. Suddenly the house in the foreground explodes to smithereens and the head of an Aurochs drives through it. Without breaking step, Aurochs maraud the village, trampling it into oblivion. We settle close on an Aurochs eye, emotionless and relentless in its calm. EXT. BATHTUB MARSH WATER - TURCK - MORNING Wink, Hushpuppy, and the Bathtub crew pole the Turck through a lake blanketed with carcasses, pushing through the dead fish, dead porpoises, dead alligator garfish like they were lily pads. There is no wind, only dense wet heat searing on the faces of the characters. The once green foliage has gone brown and thirsty HUSHPUPPY V.O. Two weeks later, everything started to die.\n\n\nWINK: (to the water) Come on fishes, where y'at? Wink empties his net- nothing but a pile of carcasses. He tips it back into the water. Wink pulls himself to the edge and sticks his head under to look for fish. Hushpuppy looks at him with an air of doubt for the first time. Wink looks ridiculous, a dead fish drifts off his head.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (WHISPERING) You wanna leave the Bathtub, Walrus?\n\n\nWALRUS: (WITHOUT THOUGHT) Nah. Wink pulls his head back up.\n\n\nWINK: I heard that. Hushpuppy fidgets guiltily.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Nobody's leaving the Bathtub! You don't know nothing! Wink lowers his net back in the water.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) (TO WALRUS) This water gonna kill us here. We gotta do something `bout this. I ain't starvin' to death while them people go grocery shopping up there. INT. SCHOOLBOAT - FLOODED - MORNING The kids sleep on Miss Bathsheba in a big pile on the floor\n\n\nHushpuppy wakes hearing SHIFTING and a SNAP behind her. Peter T is uncapping a shotgun shell and pouring black powder into a small jar. She looks out the window where Jean Battiste is unhooking a propane container from Miss Bathsheba's burner. He opens her chest freezer and hefts out a 12-foot garfish, dropping the container in the water.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: Shit! Wink sneaks up and whispers to Hushpuppy.\n\n\nWINK: Boss, Daddy's gotta take care of something. Hushpuppy is instantly concerned, she's heard this line before, and it always leads to trouble.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) I'm gonna fix everything back how it was.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Everything gonna go right back?\n\n\nWINK: Hell yeah, we gonna win. Wink pounds his chest in solidarity. Hushpuppy matches his pound, but without confidence.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Boss, anything go wrong, Walrus is Daddy. Wink and Hushpuppy look Walrus-- the face of doddering drunken bewilderment. A goat licks him. Hushpuppy is not comforted.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) You're gonna be the king of the Bathtub, I promise that. Wink can see he's getting nowhere\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Just sit here I'll be right back. The DOOR CLOSING wakes Miss Bathsheba up. She scans the room, noticing the three missing people.\n\n\nWALRUS: (an unconvincing lie) I think they be gone. I-I really can't say where.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Walrus, don't make me slap your ass! They go to the levee!? Walrus is intimidated into silence. MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) You so much as piss on that wall, you know what them people gonna do? They gonna smoke us out and stick us in a damn shelter. Hushpuppy watches Miss Bathsheba go for her boat keys. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy says, brave men don't run from their home. Hushpuppy scurries out the side window, escaping outside before Miss Bathsheba sees her. EXT. UNDER THE TURCK TARP - DAY Wink, Jean Battiste, and Peter T keep their heads above water as they float under the tarp behind the truck bed. Peter T is wearing a life jacket and still has his top hat on.\n\n\nWINK: (WHISPERING) Peter T, don't hold onto me, hold onto the boat. You gonna be fine. Jean Battiste duct tapes fireworks around the bomb: a propane tank with an igniter made from a battery and a pouch of black powder. He inserts the bomb into the stomach cavity of a giant garfish carcass\n\n\nWink shoves two propane tanks inside the belly of the garfish. He hands a rope attached to the igniter to Peter T.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Peter T, you hold the trip-line.\n\n\nPETER T: (Soft and sweet) Ok then.\n\n\nWINK: Just don't pull `til I say.\n\n\nPETER T: Ok then.\n\n\nWINK: You can do it. I have complete faith in you.\n\n\nPETER T: Ok. Jean Battiste is hesitant. Wink gives Jean Battiste a confident nod.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: Lock and load. Jean Battiste carefully unravels the string that leads to the fuse. He shoves the igniter down the mouth of the garfish. EXT. LEVEE WALL, IN THE WATER - DAY The Turck pulls into an enclosed segment of the levee, Wink bobs out from under the Turck and latches a pre-made tether running out of the garfish to a handle on the wall. He bobs back under the boat. EXT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY Hushpuppy dives under the fishing net on a motor boat just before Miss Bathsheba charges outside and keys the ignition. Hushpuppy peeks out and the boat roars to life and rips across the water\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The entire universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If you can fix the broken piece, it can all go right back. INT. UNDER THE TURCK TARP/SANTA MARIA - DAY\n\n\nWINK: Peter T hand me the- He looks, Peter T has both hands on the Turck.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Peter you didn't drop the trip- line?\n\n\nPETER T: No I did not. Peter T thinks a moment. PETER T (CONT'D) Oh, yes I did.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: Oh, Peter T.\n\n\nPETER T: I'm sorry. Wink dunks under water. EXT. LEVEE - DAY Wink surfaces in front of the igniter rope. As he grabs the rope, Bathsheba's snake catcher snares his hand and pulls his arm against the side of her Jon boat.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Here's how we do with wild animals.\n\n\nWINK: AHH! Get off me woman! I'm trying to save the Bathtub Hushpuppy watches the struggle in hiding\n\n\nBathsheba wrenches the rope out of Wink's hand and chucks it. The igniter rope lands in front of Hushpuppy under the net pile. She grabs it. She reels it in.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Get in the Boat! I'm hauling you're ass back home, little boy. Jean Battiste swims out of hiding.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: Wink!?\n\n\nWINK: Jean Battiste, get the trip line! Suddenly, Hushpuppy pops out from under the nets, holding the rope taught. She stumbles and almost sets if off by accident.\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: Hushpuppy!?\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: She got it! Pull! Pull!\n\n\nWINK: NOW BOSS!\n\n\nMISS BATHSHEBA: No! Hushpuppy! Hushpuppy, contemplates in an eerie peace. The screaming chorus FADES and she is alone in her quiet, eyes darting between Bathsheba and Wink. Courage and certainly clench inside her her. You listen to your Daddy. She pulls the rope. EXT. LEVEE WALL IN THE WATER - DAY The trip-line releases the detonator. EXT. LEVEE - NORTH SIDE - DAY The levee DETONATES. Shattered wood and cement fire towards camera\n\n\nDebris propels Hushpuppy backwards. Her quiet resumes as she lands on the deck of the boat in slow motion. She watches in a daze as smoke, water, and flaming dust cycles above her. All the beauty of the universe. EXT. FLOODPLAIN - THE BATHTUB - DAY Water recedes in the Bathtub, revealing the tragic, mud- soaked remnants of their paradise. Hushpuppy slogs through the muck, each step going two feet down into the stinking filth. The crew trudges behind her in silence. EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY The blow-up crew crests a hill and sees the remains of the ark sprawled across an open field. Wink's and Hushpuppy's eyes well up as they beholds the state of their island. The water has drained. Everything is dead. More striking than the ripped-up houses, the land surrounding the island has disappeared. Trees are gone. Shards of marsh that had been attached float in the distance. What was a dense, green landscape is barren. The Bathtub is a scorched hell. EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST-FLOOD - EVENING Hushpuppy picks through the rubble of the Shacko in the Backo. She finds their grill, and a window made from a dryer door and brings them to Wink. The Shacko has crash landed under the stilts of a house that's been entirely washed away. Wink has done some work reassembling the walls and broken parts into a semi- functional enclosure. EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST-FLOOD - LATER THAT NIGHT Hushpuppy find nails and brings them to Wink, who leans wall panels against the stilts from the previous house He hammers nails wearily. His strength is sapped. He HACKS out bile. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) It didn't matter that the water was gone. Sometimes, you can break something so bad, that it can't get put back together. INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - EVENING Hushpuppy climbs the stairs of the original house to get to the top of the Shacko. She looks down through the hole in the floor. In her POV Wink climbs into bed, he painfully takes his shirt off. The bruise on his chest has extended all the way across his stomach. Hushpuppy looks out on the water for some sign that Marietta's still with her. The light shining on the water is off. She sees nothing but dead trees and a defunct oil rig.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Mamma!? Nothing.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) Mamma where you at!? As if in response, we hear a HELICOPTER LOUDSPEAKER.\n\n\nPILOT: This is a mandatory evacuation area, you can no longer live here. Everyone in this area, has to leave. I repeat.... EXT. DEAD FOREST - MORNING Hushpuppy wades through the muck in what used to be a lush forest, now reduced to toothpick trees and mud. She finds her storage unit in the tree hollow, and lifts out the medicine jar\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When you're small, you gotta fix what you can. INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - NIGHT She pours the crushed up roots into Wink's mouth, careful not to disturb him. Wink dooesn't move. Hushpuppy gently folds in the orange fungus. Quiet, quiet--\n\n\nWINK: GUUAAAHH! Wink spews up an explosive cloud of medicine.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) God damn! Wink grabs her medicine jar and threatens her with it.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) What you doing!? He smashes it against the wall.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) What the hell's wrong with you! Hushpuppy is so upset she doesn't know what to do. She screams in anger.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Raaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! Raging, Hushpuppy breaks everything she can get her hands on, ruining everything Wink's reassembled, tipping shelves, pans, walls. She grabs a fishing pole and starts bashing Wink's grill over and over.\n\n\nWINK: You wanna throw things? Come on! I can do that too. You want to play that game? Let's throw stuff! Wink joins in, breaking stuff too, channeling all his anger into the destruction. Wink throws himself into the wall. It breaks off and dumps a series of shelves all over the floor\n\n\nHushpuppy can't believe it. Suddenly it's cathartic, they start throwing objects at each other and laughing.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Come on! Come on! Wink pegs her in the face with a stuffed animal and she grins. Hushpuppy throws a pillow!\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) AAAAH!!! COME ON! COME ON! Hushpuppy throws a shoe.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) AAAAAHHHHH!!!!! YEAH!! COME ON! Hushpuppy and Wink destroy everything in the house. Something goes off in Wink chest. He grabs his heart and collapses on the floor. Hushpuppy realizes something's not right. She throws a life- jacket at her father. Wink continues to force a smile at her. Hushpuppy won't return the smile.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Man. You think I don't know. Hushpuppy's bottom lip starts quivering. Wink's smiles disappears.\n\n\nWINK: Hey. No crying. Don't you cry man. Don't you cry! He threatens her with a shoe. Hushpuppy hides behind an overturned chest.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) HEY! Don't cry damn it! Wink hangs his head and catches his breath against the wall\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Shit. He pull himself to his feet and grabs a bottle of moonshine. He sets up two cups on the table.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Come on get a drink. Wink pours Hushpuppy a shot. Hushpuppy sips. Winces. Looks suspiciously at her father. Sips again. Wink takes one straight from the bottle.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) This counts as I'm sorry for a whole buncha things. Lord.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: You gonna be gone?\n\n\nWINK: What? No!\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: You gonna leave me alone?\n\n\nWINK: I ain't gon' leave nothing.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Cause if you be gone, I be gone too.\n\n\nWINK: Hushpuppy, that is not how it works.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I will. Sometimes in the bed I start shaking and can't stop. I got what you got.\n\n\nWINK: No man. That's just a side effect of being a stupid little girl\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I ain't gonna be dead?\n\n\nWINK: No. You? No! You gonna live a hundred years more. You know what, show me the guns. Hushpuppy shoves Wink.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Show me them guns man. Wink clears everything off the table with one sweep.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Show me the guns! Guns! guns! guns! guns! guns! Hushpuppy flexes her biceps. She begins to chant, fierce and\n\n\nTRIUMPHANT--: HUSHPUPPY\n\n\nGuns! Guns! Guns! Guns!.....\n\n\nWINK: (OVERLAPPING) Guns man, give to me! Guns! Guns! Wink holds up his hand to arm-wrestle. They SCREAM in tandem as Hushpuppy pins him hard.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Ooooo, Hushpuppy you the man. Who the man?\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I'm the man.\n\n\nWINK: Who the man!?\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I'm the man!\n\n\nWINK: TELL ME LOUDER WHO THE MAN!!!!\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I'm THE MAN!!!!!!! 52\n\n\nWINK: YOU THE MAN, RIGHT?! Wink is overcome with love. It's too much for him to bear.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Fuck this table! In a violent euphoria, Wink grabs the table and hurls it across the room. This scares Hushpuppy. She stares silently at her wild animal father, longing for something more than rage. Wink takes a step toward like he's going to comfort her, then stops, turning back.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) I gotta lay down hear? I gotta be strong. Don't be scared. Wink lays down in the corner. Hushpuppy doesn't go to bed, she just stands there.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) What? Hushpuppy waits, not backing down.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) (GIVING IN) Come here. Hushpuppy goes to Wink.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Lay down. Wink pats his heart for her to put her head down on it. A long beat.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) Hey.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Yea?\n\n\nWINK: You ain't the one who's sick\n\n\nShe listens to his BIG HUGE HEART. EXT. WET SAND MUCK EXPANSE - DAY The Aurochs move into a desolate, barren, wasteland, looking exhausted and starved. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Strong animals got no mercy. Cold wind blows them backwards. An old Aurochs falls behind the pack. Its legs give out and it lays down. It's not going to make it. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They the type of animals that eats their own Mommas and Daddies. \n\n\nCUT TO: The Aurochs cannibalize their fallen comrade, ripping skin and organs in a storm of flesh and gore. The CRIES of the screaming mother melt together with another, sound, more MECHANICAL... INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - MORNING The SOUND becomes recognizable as a HELICOPTER PROPELLER. Hushpuppy opens her eyes, still tucked in Wink's arm. Through the wall she sees FOUR WELL-DRESSED men. They are out of place like aliens exiting their space ship. She rouses Wink, he hears the FOREIGN SOUNDING VOICES and yanks Hushpuppy up. He instinctively pulls him and Hushpuppy behind the over-turned table and grabs a broken chair leg to defend them with. EVACUATOR (O.S.) (from outside the door) This is a mandatory evacuation area. Everyone in this region has to leave. Wink hurls the chair leg at the intruders as they try to enter\n\n\nWINK: We ain't going nowhere! Hushpuppy grabs a chair leg as well. It's a standoff. INT. LADY JO'S HOUSE - POST FLOOD - MORNING Three evacuation workers ram the door of Little Jo's house. Little Jo greets the intruders brandishing a cutting knife and civil war era pistol.\n\n\nLITTLE JO: You gonna have to shoot me cause I'm not going.\n\n\nEVACUATOR 2: Ma'am we're not gonna shoot you.\n\n\nLITTLE JO: I ain't never left here and I won't never will. She spits. They get closer. LITTLE JO (CONT'D) Son, don't make me cancel your birth certificate. The Muscle grabs her by the weapons and in the struggle, slam her to the ground. It's horrible.\n\n\nEVACUATOR 2: Relax, relax ma'am.\n\n\nLITTLE JO: YOU SON OF A BITCH! They drag Little Jo out of the house. INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - MORNING MATCH CUT to Wink and Hushpuppy pinned and being dragged out.\n\n\nWINK: Get your hands off of her! I'm gonna kill you! Let her go! 55\n\n\nEXT. REFUGEE CAMP - DAY CRASH CUT TO an off-white monolithic community center surrounded by a cement parking lot. Stressed, amateur looking doctors from the real world move in and out of the glass doors. A makeshift sign reads \"Open Arms Processing Center.\" INT. REFUGEE CAMP - COTS - DAY The interior of the refugee camp is violently, fluorescent- lit and painted white in an attempt to maintain a facade of sterility. Hushpuppy stares at the strange and modern ceiling like they've descended from another planet. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) It didn't look like a prison, it looked like a fish tank with no water. The Bathtub residents walk through the gymnasium which has been converted into a holding tank/hospital for refugees. Student doctors are examining, treating, feeding people. The abandoned souls, the sick, and the old are lined up waiting for assistance. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - KITCHEN - DAY A processed egg patty jiggles weirdly as it hits Hushpuppy's tray.\n\n\nWINK: Don't eat that. DR. MALONEY, a clean-cut, over-extended handsome young doctor hustles toward the lunch line. DR. MALONEY Mr. Doucet, can I have a word with you, we found something in your test. It's-\n\n\nWINK: Whoa whoa whoa, not in front of my kid. Stay, Hushpuppy\n\n\nWink pulls Maloney out of earshot. DR. MALONEY Mr. Doucet, there's no easy way to say this... Hushpuppy struggles to hear more, only a couple words come through the din of refugees. DR. MALONEY (CONT'D) ...require surgery immediately...you need to think about what you want for your daughter...you could die. In Hushpuppy's POV: Maloney puts a sympathetic hand on Wink's shoulder and Wink pushes it off violently. Maloney puts up his hands in peace and Wink shoves him through one of the curtains and is assaulted by a flood of orderlies.\n\n\nWINK: I don't need nothing from you! You keep your hands off her! I don't need nothing from y'all! Let me go! Hushpuppy is snatched as she fights to come to his rescue.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Daddy! They tackle Wink to the ground. He goes limp as he falls. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - COTS - DAY We TRACK with Wink as he comes to consciousness rolling through the cots. He is sedated and being pushed in a wheelchair. He looks through an open door. In Wink's POV- Joy, Tee-Lou, Lizard, and the rest of Bathsheba's original school class play in a room with a BABYSITTER. She tickles Hushpuppy, who has been given new clothes and looks like a normal little girl for the first time. Her boots and boys underpants have been traded for a delicate blue dress. The image is jarring\n\n\nBABYSITTER: Hushpuppy needs a hug.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I don't want your hug! The Babysitter squeezes Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy tries to squirm away.\n\n\nBABYSITTER: Hushpuppy, that's not how nice girls act. Say \"I'm sorry ma'am.\" Hey! Say it. Say it or you're going to corner time. Hushpuppy's eyes meet Wink's and she freezes at his horrifying appearance. Wink grabs a sofa trying to stop the wheelchair as it rolls by. His fingers slips off, too weak to hold on. He tries to scream and nothing but a SEDATED MOAN comes out of his mouth. He tries to pull the tubes out of his arm.\n\n\nORDERLY: (gently moving Wink's hand AWAY)\n\n\nThere there, sir. Hushpuppy stares in shock as Wink is wheeled away. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - WINK'S ROOM - NIGHT Hushpuppy watches in hiding as a hand covered in a rubber glove changes the bandage on a surgical scar; it looks infected and mishandled. The same hand puts pills in Wink's mouth. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - TERMINAL WARD - DAY Hushpuppy stands over an old man on an artificial respirator. She's creeps closer, examining him. She puts her head on his chest. His heart is beating. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When an animal gets sick here, they plug it into the wall. She whispers in his ear\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: They're coming for you. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - TERMINAL WARD - A DIFFERENT BED - DAY She repeats the process with another vegetable. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy says, if he ever got so old he couldn't drink beer, or catch catfish, that I had to put him in a boat, and set him on fire, so no one could come plug him into the wall. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - WINK'S ROOM - NIGHT Hushpuppy peeks through the curtains at another terminal bed. She sees two orderlies force pills into Wink's mouth. He's regaining his strength and is able to hold them off momentarily before submitting, and going limp. Hushpuppy bolts, unable to take it. We stay in the room as the orderlies walk away. Wink peeks to make sure they're gone, then spits his pills on the floor. Wink stares at the ceiling for a long beat. Then, with a burst of energy he grabs his morphine drip and topples himself onto the floor. He pulls his wires out. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - KID'S ROOM - MORNING Hushpuppy lies asleep in a pile with Tee-Lou, Lizard, and Joy. Wink enters and jostles her awake.\n\n\nWINK: Boss. Let's go.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Where we goin'? 59\n\n\nINT. REFUGEE CAMP - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Wink and the girls hustle to the entrance of the Refugee center. Walrus comes running down the hall, pushing Peter T on a gurney. Wink looks bewildered, the rest of the team seems to have their own plan afoot. INT. REFUGEE CAMP - COTS - MORNING Jean Battiste and Little Jo charge through the cots riling refugees into revolt as the orderlies chase them trying to maintain decorum.\n\n\nJEAN BATTISTE: Go home! Everybody get up! Don't you want to go home? Lets go! These people don't care about you! Little Jo fights off an orderly with a syringe.\n\n\nLITTLE JO: You live in this hell hole! INT/EXT. REFUGEE CAMP - EVACUATION BUS - DAY Wink runs the kids toward the bus, they pass two busses labeled for Salt Lake City, Des Moines. Wink helps Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard get on. Then Hushpuppy. Suddenly Wink's hand slips out of Hushpuppy's. He steps away from the evacuating bus. Hushpuppy turns and the bus door slams between them.\n\n\nWINK: (from outside the door) Make sure you put her somewhere good ok? Wink sags. He's giving her away. He turns to leave..\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (banging on the door) NO! I ain't running! No! 60\n\n\nWink walks away from the bus, his chest heaving, his face clutched in the horror of what he's done. Behind him, the bus pulls forward, then veers violently. Hushpuppy charges the driver clawing at her face, punching and kicking.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) Let me go! The driver pulls the break and Hushpuppy bangs the doors open. She charges Wink from behind, gives him a diving shove. He topples over.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) You trying to get rid of me! You trying to get rid of me!\n\n\nWINK: No!\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Why you trying to get rid of me?\n\n\nWINK: I ain't trying to get rid of you.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: You is.\n\n\nWINK: No. Hushpuppy... I can't take care of you no more.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Yes you can. Hushpuppy stares him down, accusing.\n\n\nWINK: Daddy's dying! Hushpuppy's chest heaves up and down.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) My blood is eating itself. You know what that means? 61\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Don't be sayin' about dying.\n\n\nWINK: Everybody's Daddy dies.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Not my Daddy.\n\n\nWINK: Yes, your Daddy! Her defiance is broken and the information starts to sink in. It hurts Wink as much as it hurts her.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) I didn't want you to watch that, ok? You understand? Wink doubles over hacking. He COUGHS horribly. Hushpuppy looks down and sees blood spotting the grass, dripping from his mouth. The Bathtub gangs charges out the door! Across the parking lot they go in a spree of euphoria, coming to a halt around Wink. Hushpuppy is trying to drag his limp body across the parking lot.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Come on! Come on! Little Jo hold Hushpuppy away from him.\n\n\nWINK: Walrus, get me home. EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY The Bathtub crew carries Wink through the entrance to town. His arms slug over Walrus and Jean Battiste, he's barely able to help walk. We sense from the weary faces and silent eyes that it's been a long journey home\n\n\nINT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY They drag Wink through the Shacko entrance. Everyone goes in except Hushpuppy who stops outside the door as they lay him down in convulsions. She stays and tries to watch. Wink tries to say something to Walrus and can't. Blood bubbles out of his mouth. Wink catches Hushpuppy's eye then looks away as fast as he can. Reeling, but steady, Hushpuppy backs out the door. EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY Hushpuppy walks down the road in an almost eerie state of calm. She takes in the remnants of rusting houses and flipped boats, her lifeless ghost town. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Everybody looses the thing that made them, it's even how it's supposed to be in nature. EXT. LAVA RIDGE - DAY Now with her three friends, she tip-toes past several humongous footprints up to a gruesome fox carcass. Something gigantic has ripped open its stomach and gutted it. She leans over, unafraid, trying to understand it's meaning. Flies swarm and nibble, their movement almost elegant. Seen in close up, the gory mess has a strange beauty to it. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The brave men stay and watch it happen. They don't run. A SONIC BOOM springs her upright, she looks around for the source of the sound. Is it an Aurochs? She looks towards the muddy bayou. The SONIC BOOM sounds again and the entire body of water quivers with the impact. EXT. DARDAR RIDGE - EVENING The beacon blinks out on the water Hushpuppy stares towards it. The children are gathered behind her. Something has changed in her eyes. The eerie calm has given way to a hardened determination. Though unclear to us, her internal path of action is certain. She takes a deep breath, and lets out a WARRIOR CRY. She runs straight into the water with her girl gang charging behind her. EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - EVENING Joy, Tee-Lou, Lizard, and Hushpuppy swim through open water, pulling each other forward. They head in the direction of the beacon.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Come on! Keep going! They try to kick toward the light but are getting nowhere, the current pulls them backwards. We hear a BOAT HORN and they look to where an ANCIENT TUG BOAT with a cabin that towers into the sky like a giraffe head, appears through the mist. EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - SERGEANT MAJOR'S BOAT - EVENING The girls climb aboard, lifting each other onto the deck. They look up to the sound of FOOTSTEPS on the upper deck. Hushpuppy looks up to see SERGEANT MAJOR  - A big, timeless looking man with a salt and pepper moustache, saunters up to the rail. He stares down, examining these runts with an air of suspicion.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I'm going by my Mamma. He smiles broadly, as if this was the secret password. Him and Hushpuppy stare at each other and immediately there is understanding. Two lost souls in the wilderness.\n\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: That's a good place to go\n\n\nEXT. GULF OF MEXICO - SERGEANT MAJOR'S BOAT - EVENING Hushpuppy sits adjacent to the Sergeant in the tug's elevated wheelhouse. They are two stories up, and the white walls create a glow that makes us feel like we're almost in another dimension.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: Which way are we going?\n\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Don't matter baby, this boat'll take you exactly where you need to be. It's just that type of boat. Hushpuppy and Sergeant Major share an ease unlike anyone else we've seen Hushpuppy interacted with. The speak like an old teacher with his favorite disciple. They let their silences last. SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D) You want a chicken biscuit? Hushpuppy shakes her head `no'. SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D) They're good for you. A deep, far away melancholy settles over him. He munches on a chicken biscuit, then tosses the wrapper on the floor. The wheelhouse is wall to wall with chicken biscuit wrappers. SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D) I been eating these all my life. I keep the wrappers in the boat, `cause they remind me who I was when I ate each one. The smell make me feel cohesive.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I wanna be cohesive.\n\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Oh you will be, I got no doubt in my mind. They let this thought settle, then Hushpuppy turns her swivel chair back toward the water 65\n\n\nThe beacon appears through the mist. Hushpuppy's eyes go wide. As they approach, another boat comes into view. A half- sunken barge that looks as though its been rusting in the same position for a century. As we move in we see a lit up sign: \"Elysian Fields Floating Catfish Shack GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS.\" EXT./INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - ENTRANCE - EVENING Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard disembark onto the barge with Sergeant Major following behind. They circle around a hatch in the floor with light pulsing out of it. Far-away JAZZ echoes up from the bowels of the ship. They look to each other in wonder. INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT Hushpuppy descends a ladder into a glimmering wonderland. Christmas lights swallow the ceiling, and a light smoke facade encompasses everything. We feel like we're looking at a portal into the past, a Belloq-esque turned New Orleans Jazz parlor. The regulars are all oil-workers wooing their ladies of the night. There is a stage with a DJ and two singers, karaokeing along with \"Until the Real Thing Comes Along\" by Fats Waller. The hyperactive MISS FRANKIE, the matriarch of this establishment, comes a'hoppin'.\n\n\nMISS FRANKIE: Holy crap you have toddlers!\n\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Good afternoon, Miss Frankie.\n\n\nMISS FRANKIE: Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit! How you, Sergeant Major? You need some grits?\n\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Yes ma'am\n\n\nMISS FRANKIE: Holy Sugar, they are so precious! Y'all just as cute as a tub of puppies! Women descend on the kids who recoil, not knowing what to do with all this affection. Joy Strong puts up her fists. Hushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry of doting ladies. They are not who she is looking for. They are not who she is looking for. She scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up all over the ceiling, each of them with a bra hung on it, none of them right. Bar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes, ladies smile and return to their drinks, drunk flirtatious dancers giggle at her, but she remains unfazed. She reaches two swinging doors that lead to the kitchen. Hushpuppy stops. Sniffs. Heaven. SLOW MOTION: in Hushpuppy's POV, smoke curls through the swinging doors, the light illuminating the dust particles. It's a magic kitchen. Her POV tilts down to the floor where a pair of well-pedicured feet in flip-flops walks towards the swinging doors. They open. Hushpuppy holds her breath. A gorgeous COOK  wearing a baseball cap and an apron comes out the double doors. She wipes some sweat off her brow. She watches the band and kills a bottle of ice-cold beer. The Cook looks down. Sees Hushpuppy.\n\n\nCOOK: You need something baby? Hushpuppy nods, holding her breath. She still can't speak.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) Well whatchu want? You alone? Hushpuppy shrugs. She's too stunned, too shy to speak\n\n\nThe Cook takes stock of the helpless creature in front of her. Like a butcher shop owner with a pesky hungry puppy, she submits to Hushpuppy's longing gaze.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) Get in here, I'm'll show you a magic trick. Hushpuppy follows her into the magic kitchen, knocking her head against the swinging doors on her way in. INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - KITCHEN With the smooth fanfare of a circus performer, The Cook lifts an egg, opens a beer bottle with her teeth, SPITS the cap at the egg and it cracks over the grits. Hushpuppy's face is joy beyond all measure. She watches the Cook's flying hands, she prepares everything in a single motion, it's like a dance. She slaps a fresh alligator tail on the table and begins sawing through the scales.\n\n\nCOOK: Lemme tell you somethin', when you're a child people tell you that everything's gonna be all hunky- dory and all that bullshit, but I'm here to tell you that it's not. So get that out your head right now. She removes the knife from the gator and aims it at Hushpuppy like its a pointer.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) Life's some big old feast, yeah, but you? You ain't nothin' but a stupid little waitress. She scales a gator, strips the bones, dredges, fries.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) Everything you got on your platter gonna fall on the floor and ain't nobody gonna be there to pick it up for you. Someday it's all gonna be on you\n\n\nShe stirs the grits. Grits on plate. Gator on plate. Plate in front of Hushpuppy. Lemon is squeezed all over everything.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) So smile, girl. Hushpuppy tries to crack a grin. She barely remembers how to smile and it comes out all wrong. The Cook shakes her head, opens another beer on her teeth, and heads for the pantry.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) Nobody likes a pity-party-having- ass-woman. Hushpuppy stays behind staring into the floating particles of dust in the incandescent light-- stars of the universe. The golden bubbling fry pot-- lava of the molten core. INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT Four perfect gator nuggets are placed next to a sumptuous dollop of grits.\n\n\nCOOK: The gator's magic. Hushpuppy looks up from her food-hypnosis.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) (encouraging a smile) Awwwwwwwww. A real smile emerges across Hushpuppy's face.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) Mmm-hmm. INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT Magic soars as the couples rock back and forth on the dance floor. Strippers cradle their dates. It's all very sweet and tender. This seems to be the M.O of this strip club, slow-dance not pole-dance. The kids are each dancing with a stripper, glowing with love. They are orphans in a heaven of mothers\n\n\nWe float back to Hushpuppy, the camera dances with her and the Cook. The Cook squeezes Hushpuppy and spins her. Each time we catch their face their eyes are wetter and wetter.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: You can take care of me. Me and Daddy. After a long beat. The Cook shakes her head `no.'\n\n\nCOOK: I don't know nothing bout your Daddy, I can't take care of nobody but myself. This sinks into Hushpuppy.\n\n\nCOOK: (CONT'D) You can stay if you want. Hushpuppy considers this for a moment, squeezes the Cook.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: This is my favorite thing.\n\n\nCOOK: I know. A far-away look has come over her. Her mind is somewhere else. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) I can count all the time I've been lifted. INT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY We look up at a face that's slowly coming into focus- it's Wink, younger and healthier. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) I can count all the times I've been lifted on two fingers\n\n\nHe is the first sight of the slimy newborn baby girl tucked in his arm. Baby Hushpuppy stares up at him as he carries her. WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S) Wink! Bring my baby here! They need to wash her off.\n\n\nWINK: Naw, that waits. Baby Hushpuppy's huge-eyed, warped facial expression ogles Wink. She coos.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) (TO HUSHPUPPY) Alright fatso, breathe some air. They pass through a doorway and sun washes over Baby Hushpuppy. She smiles and smiles at the world. INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCEFLOOR - NIGHT Back in reality Hushpuppy gathers herself. She's suddenly not hugging back, just being held.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: I need to go home.\n\n\nCOOK: (WHISPERED) No. Hushpuppy cups her hand to the Cook's ear and whispers something inaudible. The Cook squeezes her tight, seeming on the verge of adopting her. But she can't. She spins Hushpuppy around and around, then puts her down withouth meeting her gaze. Hushpuppy watches her disappear into the crowd of swaying couples. All goes quiet, and we sit behind Hushpuppy's head, a sea of light like a crown around her. MUSIC SWELLS. Decisively, with the force of a charging general, Hushpuppy turns and runs toward camera\n\n\nEXT. DEAD OAK RIDGE - DAY MATCH CUT to Hushpuppy leading Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard across a ridge dotted with Dead Oak trees, she's come back to the Bathtub. EXT. DEAD OAK RIDGE - WATER - DAY The camera moves over the water, past the dead oaks. We turn the corner past a stretch of marsh, and come upon the Aurochs, four of them, now suddenly and viscerally in the landscape of the Bathtub, swimming steadily toward solid land. INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY The Bathtub crew sits by Wink's bed. His eyes are open, but everyone is silently waiting for the inevitable. EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY The children crest the ridge. The RUMBLE of Aurochs hoofs is suddenly and violently audible. Hushpuppy turns. She catches a glimpses of something massive moving behind the distant oaks. The kids turn and hustle down the ridge. Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard hustle down hill with increased urgency. The DISTANT TRAMPLING is growing louder. Behind Hushpuppy the dark shapes of the Aurochs crest the ridge in a deafening STAMPEDE. Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard scream and sprint out in front of Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy walks steadily forward, refusing to run. Her face locked with determination, she is unafraid. Her eyes shoot toward the shacko. EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY Wink, with all his strength looks toward Hushpuppy, their eyes meet In Wink's POV, Hushpuppy stops dead on the bridge, waiting for her fate, staring toward her father. EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY The Aurochs bear down on Hushpuppy from behind, their footsteps rattling the frame. They grow inconceivably large, the camera has to tilt to hold the frame. Hushpuppy balls her fists and stands her ground. Suddenly, she turns. The Aurochs ROARS. Then, inches away from Hushpuppy, she stops. She SNORTS, blowing Hushpuppy's hair back. Hushpuppy doesn't flinch. The Aurochs stares face to face with Hushpuppy. Sniffs. EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY Wink is frozen in wonder, unable to believe his eyes. EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY Hushpuppy raises her chin in confident defiance. Now in full profile, we see the Aurochs towering 15-feet tall, she takes a step forwards, sniffs again. A low SNORT, or is it a purr? The Aurochs lowers her head with respect. Her eyes well with emotion, recognizing one of her own. A ferocious warrior. The Aurochs steps back, takes a knee, and with a BELLY FLOP that rattles the very earth, she lays down. Her three companions follow suit, their fat tummies settling into an almost joyful, lazy, repass. A strange calm has settled over Hushpuppy. Almost a smile, but more of a peace and an affection for her equal. They're both children in their way.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: You're my friend, kind of\n\n\nMother Aurochs grunts, a sentence only Hushpuppy can understand.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: (CONT'D) I gotta take care of mine. With weary and clumsy steps, the Aurochs stand and retreat. EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY Hushpuppy approaches the shacko. It's like walking the plank, but she's unafraid, at one with her destiny. The Bathtub crew look on her in awe. They part ways to let her pass. She reaches the door, steeling her reserve. Hushpuppy opens the door. INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY Wink is curled up on Hushpuppy's bed-- very, very thin. His eyes are closed. His chest heaves up and down in short violent breaths. Hushpuppy stands and stares. Wink looks at Hushpuppy in reverence. He knows it's the last time. Wink motions for her to come closer. Hushpuppy inches toward him. It takes all of her might. She sits on his bed. Hushpuppy takes her to-go container from Elysian Fields out of a paper bag and pops it. She unwraps a gator nugget, dips it in hot sauce, and holds it out for Wink to take a bite. Hushpuppy watches as Wink chews weakly. She eats one herself. Wink and Hushpuppy draw it out. They don't want it to end. It takes a full minute for him to swallow the first bite, and she paces herself to finish when he does.\n\n\nWINK: (BARELY AUDIBLE) Real good\n\n\nWink's chest heaves up and down, harder and harder. A tear rolls down his face.\n\n\nWINK: (CONT'D) (CHOKING UP) No crying, you hear? She holds them back, being tough for her Daddy.\n\n\nHUSHPUPPY: No crying. Hushpuppy's face hardens, and even as the tears fall, we see a strength and composure that only Wink could have put there. She falls into his arms and he embraces her. Hushpuppy squeezes Wink. She does not let go. She stays strong. Wink's hand trembles on her back. She holds him as his deep, warm, heartbeat slows, slows, and stops. His weight slumps over her. She keeps on holding him, but she knows. EXT. GRAVEYARD BY THE WATER - DAY Steadfast, Hushpuppy holds a torch on the edge of the Bathtub. The Turck, piled with branches, floats in front of her. She lowers the flame and lights a cloth covering Wink's body aflame. She pushes the funeral pyre out into the current. We watch the boat flames drift into the foreground, covering Hushpuppy face with flames. She looks into them in all her grief and wisdom. The group begins a funeral prayer, playing quiet in the background as Hushpuppy contemplates the pyre.\n\n\nPETER T: As I stand by the bayou, Everyone else joins him.\n\n\nEVERYONE: A ship at my side starts her motors and sails for the gulf. I watch her until she disappears. \"There! (MORE) 75\n\n\nEVERYONE: (CONT'D) She's gone!\" Gone where? Gone from my eyes, that's all. She's just as big as when she left me. And somewhere else, other voices are calling out, \"Here she comes!\" And that is dying. They raise their drinks to the sky and shout in unison.\n\n\nEVERYONE: (CONT'D) HERE! SHE! COMES! Hushpuppy gazes into the sparks leaping off the top of the fire are foregrounded in front of Hushpuppy, particles of Wink jumping into the sky. HORNS ENTER, droning low, and building into an funeral dirge. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When I relax behind my eyes I see everything that made me flying around in invisible pieces. When I look too hard it goes away, but when it all goes quiet, I see they are right here. The Turck almost disappears over the horizon. The HORNS take a hopeful turn, the melancholy of the dirge mixing with the anthem of the Bathtub. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) I see that I'm a little piece of a big, big universe, and that makes things right. Hushpuppy stands tiny on the ledge of the Earth, framed in front of an expanse of endless water. EXT. CAUSEWAY - POST-FLOOD - DAY The Bathtub gang marches across the marsh road. Hands touch the town sign, saying goodbye. HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When I die, the scientists of the future, they gonna find it all. They gonna know, once there was a Hushpuppy, and she lived with her Daddy in the Bathtub\n\n\nCasino - Draft\n\n\nCASINO: By\n\n\nNicholas Pileggi EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS, 1983 - DAY SAM 'ACE' ROTHSTEIN, a tall, lean, immaculately dressed man approaches his car, opens the door, and gets inside to turn on the ignition.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.  Otherwise, what's the point? And, for a while... I believed that's the kind of love I had.\n\n\nSuddenly, the car explodes. Flames, smoke and metal rise into the sky covering the view of the Las Vegas casinos and their signs. Music in: J.S. Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'. Ace's body comes flying in - extreme slow motion. His body twists and turns through the frame like a soul about to tumble into the flames of damnation. MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE. INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT Vignette of ACE through rippling flames, we move in on ACE ROTHSTEIN overseeing the casino. He lights a cigarette.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Before I ever ran a casino or got myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper, I can tell you that. I was so good, that whenever I bet, I could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country. I'm serious. I had it down so cold that I was given paradise on earth. I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...\n\n\nINT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT Vignette of MOB BOSSES sitting at a table surrounded by food and wine like the gods of Olympus.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars.

But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us were ever given anything that fuckin' valuable again.\n\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT Aerial shot coming down out of the clouds over the brightly lit Vegas Strip and off into the blackness of the desert night.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) At that time, Vegas was a place where millions of suckers flew in every year on their own nickel, and left behind about a billion dollars. But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas...\n\n\nEXT. DESERT - DAWN Aerial shot swooping along the desert floor, then rising above the mist to reveal mountains in the distance.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.\n\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP, 1973 - NIGHT TITLE IN: 'THE STRIP', 'LAS VEGAS', 'TEN YEARS EARLIER' ACE is greeted by a casino exec and walked through the brightly lit entrance to the Tangiers Casino.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.)

I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino. And that's like selling dreams for cash.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT We see ACE enter alone. He is greeted by BILLY SHERBERT. They are joined by top executives RICHIE and RONNIE in suits and ties. They walk through the casino, past crowded and noisy craps tables, spinning roulette wheels, blackjack tables, poker-faced players at poker tables, and elegant, cordoned-off, black-tie, baccarat tables.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.\n\n\nSHERBERT: (Introducing the EXECS to ACE)\n\n\n...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS/HARD COUNT ROOM - NIGHT Dolly back from a wall of money. An employee pours a bucket full of coins into a trough. Camera follows progress as numerous coins move on a conveyor system, through a sorting machine. Camera reveals several rolls of coins on a lower conveyor as they move up a ladder towards an employee's hands, who then places the rolls on a rack.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...comes cash. Tons of it. I mean, what do you think we're doing out here in the middle of the desert? It's all this money. This is the end result of all the bright lights and the comped trips, of all the champagne and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze. It's all been arranged just for us to get your money. That's the truth about Las Vegas.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS/FLOOR/SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY Camera follows JOHN NANCE carrying a small suitcase and walking through the casino to a door leading to the cashier's cage. The sign on the door reads 'Authorized Personnel Only'. He walks through the cage, to another door: 'Notice - Keep Out'.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) We're the only winners. The players don't stand a chance. And their cash flows from the tables to our boxes ...through the cage and into the most sacred room in the casino ...the place where they add up all the money ...the holy of holies ...the count room.\n\n\nHe opens the door. We see inside the count room from NANCE'S point of view. It looks like the area behind a teller's cage in a bank. A large room, windowless, decor-free. One side is a mesh cage, opened to reveal stacks of cash boxes. Several COUNTERS in white shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and sorting paper money.)\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Now this place was off limits.\n\n\nCOUNTER #1: Verify two thousand.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Even I couldn't get inside, but it was my job to keep it filled with cash. That's for sure.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) They had so much fuckin' money in there, you could build a house out of stacks of $100 bills. And the best part was that upstairs, the board of directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.\n\n\nAt one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and rapidly count the cash at a counting table. The camera follows a cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a clerk. He pours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a video camera. COUNTER #2 rapidly counts the cash and announces:\n\n\nCOUNTER #2: Five thousand.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) I mean, to them everything looked on the up and up. Right? Wrong.\n\n\nThe first counter recounts the cash.\n\n\nCOUNTER #1: Verify five thousand.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) The guys inside the counting room...\n\n\nStacks of bills lie nearby. The camera pans across the room to another table manned by a COUNT ROOM EXECUTIVE who repeats the figure and writes it down on a master list.\n\n\nCOUNT ROOM EXEC: Five thousand.\n\n\nWe move back to NANCE opening a cabinet full of stacks of $100 bills. He opens his suitcase and begins to fill it with cash. As he does this, the workers studiously look in other directions.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.  They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd even take cash right out of the drop boxes. And it was up to this guy right here [NANCE], standin' in front of about two million dollars, to skim the cash off the top without anybody gettin' wise ...the IRS or anybody.\n\n\nCOUNTER #1: Verify two hundred.\n\n\nNANCE closes the case and walks out. One of the counters dumps another container of money on the table.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Now, notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything. Somehow, somebody's always lookin' the other way. Now, look at these guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy, right?  They're countin' money. Who wants to bother them? I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.\n\n\nNANCE exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of the casino, passing ACE and SHERBERT, to a side exit door.\n\n\nNICKY: Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra c-note a week just to watch the door.  I mean, it's routine. Business as usual: in, out, hello, goodbye. And that's all there is to it. Just another fat fuck walkin' out of the casino with a suitcase. Now, that suitcase was goin' straight to one place: right to Kansas City ...which was as close to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go without gettin' themselves arrested.\n\n\nNANCE leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the curb. EXT. KANSAS CITY AIRPORT - DAY NANCE arrives. He is greeted by ARTIE PISCANO, a gray-haired sixty-year-old underboss. TITLE IN: 'KANSAS CITY'\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted ...and they wanted it every month.\n\n\nPISCANO: Hey, John, how are you? How was your ride?\n\n\nEXT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY NANCE, with suitcase, and PISCANO leave the car and enter the produce market.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Now this old Mormon fuck here... \n\n\nCUT TO: NANCE, AS HE GETS OUT OF PISCANO'S CAR\n\n\nINT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY NANCE and PISCANO walk through the grocery store, through the warehouse, past various employees to a doorway leading into the back room, where they are greeted by five older men around a large wooden table with bowls of macaroni and old jelly glasses filled with red wine.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy.\n\n\nNANCE: Somethin' smells good.\n\n\nPISCANO: Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) The bosses would come from all over the place: Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee. All over the Midwest. And they would meet in the back of this produce market in Kansas City. I mean, nobody even knew.\n\n\nNANCE shakes hands with AMERICO CAPELLI, sixty-eight, a bald, affable Milwaukee entrepreneur and ARTHUR CAPP, his thirty- year-old yuppie lawyer son. Camera continues to pan around the room.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) One of the guys made his mother do all the cooking.\n\n\nOn VINCENT BORELLI, seventy-year-old Kansas City boss.\n\n\nBORELLI: Did you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?\n\n\nOn VINNIE FORLANO, mid-seventies, an old-timer who once drove for Capone and is now Remo Gaggi's right-hand man.\n\n\nFORLANO: Jerry Steriano?\n\n\nBORELLI: Yeah.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Now, these old greaseballs might not look it, but believe me, these are the guys who secretly controlled Las Vegas.\n\n\nPISCANO joins his MOTHER and DAUGHTER by a stove.\n\n\nPISCANO'S MOTHER: That man's here again.\n\n\nPiscano dips a piece of bread into a pot of tomato sauce.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Because they controlled the Teamsters' Union, and that's where you had to go if you wanted to borrow money to buy a casino.\n\n\nBORELLI: (O.S.) When you've finished with him, I want him.\n\n\nPISCANO'S MOTHER: (Carrying a plate of food to the table where BORELLI and FORLANO are seated.)\n\n\nHere you are, gentlemen.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) And nobody got a Teamsters' loan, unless the guys in this room knew they were gonna get their little suitcases.\n\n\nFORLANO gets up from the table and walks toward NANCE.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Guys like this antique here [FORLANO], out of Detroit. Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top boss.\n\n\nNANCE embraces REMO GAGGI who's seated on a couch, and sits across from him.\n\n\nGAGGI: You got a round figure on it?\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Definitely the most important guy in this room.\n\n\nNANCE: (Picking up the suitcase)\n\n\nAbout twenty pounds.\n\n\nGAGGI: So?\n\n\nNANCE: That's around seven hundred thousand.\n\n\nGAGGI: Uh-huh, good.\n\n\nNANCE opens the case to reveal the money.\n\n\nANDY STONE: (Off-screen, from following scene)\n\n\nI know it's a little early for Las Vegas... INT. TANGIERS EXECUTIVE OFFICE PRESS CONFERENCE/BANQUET ROOM - DAY Camera tilts down a model of the Tangiers Hotel and Casino, then reveals the cover of Business Week magazine with a drawing of PHILIP GREEN, a young corporate type, smiling out under the headline: 'Philip Green, Vegas Wunderkind'.\n\n\nSTONE: (O.S.) ...but I do want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry.\n\n\nOn ANDY STONE, a middle-aged man at a podium giving a speech while GREEN, seated at a table, looks on. PHOTOGRAPHERS flash their cameras. ACE and SHERBERT, sitting next to GREEN, also watch the photo op ceremony.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.\n\n\nSTONE: This is a very auspicious occasion.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) A powerful man.\n\n\nSTONE: Philip, if you would rise.\n\n\nGreen stands up.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) He even played golf with the President.\n\n\nSTONE: On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...\n\n\nSTONE: (Handing GREEN a large cardboard facsimile 'check')\n\n\n...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.\n\n\nGREEN: Thank you.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...he did what he was told.\n\n\nPHILIP GREEN, who is now the head of the Tangiers Hotel and Casino Corporation, is standing at the podium giving a speech.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Now here was the perfect front man. I mean, what the fuck else could he be?  He didn't know too much. He didn't want to know too much, especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him the money. He wanted to believe the Teamsters gave him all that fuckin' money 'cause he was smart.\n\n\nAn exploding flash bulb fills the screen.\n\n\nGREEN: ...I say that, knowing full well just how much competition we have in this great city.\n\n\nEXT. CHEAP MOTEL OFF HIGHWAY - DAY We see a MAN and a WOMAN swimming underwater. Camera reveals that they are in a motel swimming pool with glass portholes. Expensive cars are parked outside one of the rooms. Hoods stand around outside the door.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) And where they got Green from - who the fuck knows?  All I know is that Green was an Arizona real estate hustler, who barely had enough gas money to come and pick up his own fuckin' check...\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS EXECUTIVE OFFICE PRESS CONFERENCE/BANQUET ROOM - DAY We return to the press conference. Photographers snap away. In the background are six-foot blow-ups of the Business Week cover. The camera moves past GREEN, CAPP and several other men, past SHERBERT, to ACE.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Now, all they needed was somebody they could trust to run the casino. And who better than Ace?  I mean, he was already in Vegas a couple of years and he had the fuckin' place clocked.\n\n\nFREEZE FRAME ON ACE. INT. TANGIERS SWIMMING POOL - DAY Camera looks straight down from the top of a hotel to a large pool area.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) But typical Ace...\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS SWIMMING POOL/POOLSIDE - DAY STONE, in a bathing suit and robe, sits on a lounge chair with a telephone. ACE, in sports clothes, sits on another chair.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.\n\n\nACE: You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.\n\n\nSTONE: You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.\n\n\nACE: But what happens when they do find out?\n\n\nSTONE: Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.\n\n\nACE: (Exhales) It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.\n\n\nSTONE: You got it.\n\n\nACE: I'm serious. No interference.\n\n\nSTONE: Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.\n\n\nStone lights a cigarette. INT. TANGIERS CRAPS PIT - NIGHT ACE blows on a die.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) And that's how that got Ace to take over.\n\n\nACES's hands place the die into a micrometer.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) They wanted him because Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling.\n\n\nCamera swish tilts up to ACE, then swish pans to boxman, dealers and players watching him, trying to act calm.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) They worked out a real cute job title too.\n\n\nWe see the die in the micrometer.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Tangiers Public Relations Director.\n\n\nSatisfied the die is not loaded ACE sets it on the craps table, the camera cranes up to reveal the Tangiers Casino floor.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) But the only thing he ever directed was the casino. He made his first bet when he was fifteen years old, and he always made money. But he didn't bet like you or me.\n\n\nA DEALER is sliding chips, tossing them on to a craps table.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.\n\n\nACE: (Approaching the DEALER) Where the hell did you learn how to deal? (He reaches down, stacking and arranging the chips.)\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.\n\n\nACE: (To the chastised DEALER)\n\n\nPlace the checks properly. That's the way you do it.\n\n\nDEALER: Yes, sir.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) He had to know everything, this guy.\n\n\nDirect overhead tracking shot as ACE walks between two rows of gaming tables.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) He'd find out the kind of inside stuff nobody else knew, and that's what he'd put his money on.\n\n\nINT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT, BACK HOME, PRE-SEVENTIES - DAY ACE walks past two boxers sparring in a ring, through a doorway into a room where several gamblers are seated around a table.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Even back home, years ago, when we were first hangin' out together...\n\n\nTITLE IN: 'BACK HOME, YEARS AGO'\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...he'd know if the quarterback was on coke.\n\n\nACE is looking at the odds board for college football games. The bookie, LUCKY LARRY, is waiting for ACE to hand in his picks.\n\n\nACE: I'll take Columbia for twenty.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) If his girlfriend was knocked up.\n\n\nLUCKY LARRY: Twenty dimes on Columbia . . .\n\n\nAs soon as ACE bets, a man erases a number from the chalkboard and replaces it was a '6', changing the odds. Two GAMBLERS saunter from the room.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) He'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals. He even figured out the different bounce you got off the different kinds of wood they used on college basketball courts, you know?\n\n\nEXT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT PUBLIC PHONES - DAY The two GAMBLERS we saw sauntering out of the bookie joint are racing to the nearest public phones. Another GAMBLER has already beaten them to it.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) He'd be workin' on this shit day and night. There was nothin' about a game he was gonna bet that he didn't know.\n\n\nGAMBLER #1: (Into phone) Ace got down at six.\n\n\nGAMBLER #2: (Into phone) Charlie, hey. Rothstein got six.\n\n\nINT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT, SEVERAL DAYS LATER - DAY A bookie hands a stack of money to another bookie, who hands the money to ACE. ACE removes several bills from the top of the stack of winnings and holds them out to the BOOKIES.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Season after season, the prick was the only guaranteed winner I ever knew. But he was so serious about it all that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.  But...\n\n\nACE exits.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...that's just the way he was.\n\n\nINT. MOB SOCIAL CLUB BACK ROOM - NIGHT The room has an espresso machine and a saint's day calendar. Assorted hoods are listening to NICKY at the bar. Camera dollies to REMO GAGGI, at the rear table playing gin rummy with OLD MAN CAPO and losing. Every time the CAPO picks up a card, he's able to knock or get gin, sending GAGGI into a fit bemoaning his bad luck.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.\n\n\nGAGGI: (Slams down his cards and curses at his losing hands)\n\n\nMa che cazzo! [Italian-American slang for 'What a prick.'] All those fuckin' sweeps.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) I mean, unless Ace made his bet.\n\n\nGAGGI: That's enough now!\n\n\nOLD MAN CAPO: I can't contest the cards.\n\n\nGAGGI: Va fa 'n culo! [Italian-American slang for 'Fuck off'] (Summoning a young man.)\n\n\nJohnny!\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Ace made more money for them on a weekend than I could do heisting joints for a month.\n\n\nACE enters and walks to GAGGI's table.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Whatever Ace picked up on the street he told Remo.\n\n\nNICKY: (Walks over to ACE and whispers)\n\n\nHey, did you bring that thing?\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) You know, I mean fixed fights, doped horses, crooked fuckin' zebras... locked-in point spreads. He told fuckin' Remo everything. And to tell you the truth. I don't blame him.\n\n\nGAGGI stands up and shakes ACE's hand.\n\n\nGAGGI: Ace.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.\n\n\nGAGGI beams as ACE takes out an envelope filled with cash and hands it over to him. GAGGI sits back down and ACE, knowing his place, smiles and is about to leave.\n\n\nGAGGI: Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?\n\n\nACE: Well, that's why they paid so well.\n\n\nGAGGI: You see? (Chuckles.) Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?\n\n\nACE: Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?\n\n\nGAGGI: Okay. You come by the house?\n\n\nACE: I'll come by.\n\n\nGAGGI: Seven o'clock?\n\n\nACE: Seven o'clock.\n\n\nGAGGI gets up and kisses ACE as NICKY and OLD MAN CAPO look on.\n\n\nGAGGI: Good job, my boy. Keep it up. Okay, Ace?\n\n\nACE nods in agreement and leaves the room.\n\n\nGAGGI: (To NICKY) Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']\n\n\nNICKY: (To ACE) I'll be right out.\n\n\nGAGGI: T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? (pointing to the off- screen ACE)\n\n\nNICKY: Mm.\n\n\nGAGGI: Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.\n\n\nNICKY: Mm.\n\n\nGAGGI: Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?\n\n\nNICKY: All right.\n\n\nGAGGI: Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']\n\n\nNICKY: Yeah.\n\n\nGAGGI: Fine.\n\n\nNICKY: (Reaching down to touch GAGGI's money, joking with him.)\n\n\nWant me to take this for you? (He walks out.)\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) So, now, on top of everything else, I gotta make sure that nobody fucks around with the Golden Jew.\n\n\nINT. BACK HOME BAR - NIGHT We move past JOE, a guy at the bar entertaining a BRUNETTE and a BLONDE, to NICKY and FRANK MARINO at the other end. There are other bar patrons in the background.\n\n\nJOE: (To the BARTENDER) Chase, couple of shooters for the ladies.\n\n\nBARTENDER: (O.S.) All right.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.\n\n\nNICKY: (To MARINO) They payin'?\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) How did Nicky collect?\n\n\nMARINO: They pay every week, like they're supposed to.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Don't ask.\n\n\nNICKY: Then where the fuck is the money? I don't see the money.\n\n\nACE enters, and greets the two girls.\n\n\nACE: Hi, Melissa. Heidi.\n\n\nBLONDE: Hi, Sam.\n\n\nJOE: (To the GIRLS) Who's this guy?\n\n\nMARINO: (To NICKY) Get the fuck out of here. It was nine. I laid nine.\n\n\nACE approaches NICKY and MARINO.\n\n\nNICKY: It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.\n\n\nACE: Eight.\n\n\nNICKY: If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.\n\n\nMARINO: Well, how come I laid nine?\n\n\nNICKY: 'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...\n\n\nACE notices a pen lying on the bar. He taps JOE on the shoulder.\n\n\nACE: (To JOE) Excuse me.\n\n\nJOE: What?\n\n\nACE: (He holds up the pen) Is this yours? Your pen?\n\n\nJOE: Yeah, that's my pen. Why?\n\n\nACE: I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.\n\n\nJOE: Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?\n\n\nNICKY looks over.\n\n\nACE: Well, I was just offering you the-\n\n\nNICKY moves towards JOE.\n\n\nJOE: (Turning his back to talk to the girls, referring to ACE)\n\n\nThis fuckin' asshole. NICKY grabs the pen out of ACE's hand.\n\n\nMAN #1: (To JOE) Look out!\n\n\nBefore ACE can react, NICKY grabs JOE and starts stabbing him in the neck with the pen.\n\n\nMAN #1: Joe! Look out, Joe! Look out!\n\n\nNICKY grunts while JOE gasps and groans. The BLONDE screams while NICKY's hand continues to plunge the pen into JOE's throat. JOE tumbles to the floor. NICKY pounces on him, still stabbing and now kicking. JOE whimpers.\n\n\nNICKY: What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!\n\n\nACE: (Over whimpers and pants)\n\n\nWait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy. ACE looks stunned. NICKY's still holding the bloody pen.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) Listen...\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR, 1972 - NIGHT Camera swoops from a woman cheering as she wins at a slot- machine to a blackjack table, then to a roulette table and over to a craps table. Montage of very short cuts of chips being picked up, dice thrown, money being poured from a bucket, stacks of money.\n\n\nNICKY: (V.O.) ...with me protecting Ace, he made a fortune for the bosses. I mean that's what got him to Vegas. He was a money machine. A tremendous earner for these guys.  As soon as he took over, he doubled the fuckin' drop. With Ace the casino never saw so much money. And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT Camera moves in on ACE as he looks out over the casino. Dealers deftly stack chips, scoop up losses and pay off winners. Chips and money are everywhere. In extreme close-up slow motion a die falls on to a table. INT.

In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced- in local cowboys working. They were close to the, you know, good old boys.\n\n\nACE: (To SHERBERT) Pay him six hundred a week, tell him to walk around and look smart.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) I mean, without us, these guys, they'd still be shovellin' mule shit.\n\n\nACE points at paper cups, empty glasses and the debris of silver dollar wrappings on the floor. DON WARD, the Slots Manager in Western garb, immediately starts picking up the debris. ACE looks at WARD sternly.\n\n\nACE: Ward, you gotta keep a cleaner station. If you need 'Mr Clean', page him, all right?\n\n\nWARD bends down and picks up some trash.\n\n\nWARD: It won't happen again, Sam.\n\n\nACE: Mr Rothstein.\n\n\nACE: (To SHERBERT) Is this guy just another dumb fuckin' white man, or what? What's his story?\n\n\nSHERBERT: We need this guy.\n\n\nACE: We can't get rid of him?\n\n\nSHERBERT: He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.\n\n\nACE: I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.\n\n\nThey exit. INT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - NIGHT A card shoe slides across the baccarat table. A state SENATOR, a little drunk, tips the dealer, kisses the blonder HOOKER with him, fills his pockets with his winnings and walks over to see ACE.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) These yokels ran the state.\n\n\nDEALER #1: Thank you very much, Senator.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) They passed the laws, they owned the courts.\n\n\nSENATOR: Hi, Ace.\n\n\nACE: Hello, Senator.\n\n\nThey shake hands.\n\n\nSENATOR: (To ACE) Hey, I need a room. Need a room.\n\n\nACE: Good to see ya. (To SHERBERT) William would you...\n\n\nThe SENATOR shakes hands with SHERBERT as the HOOKER joins them.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.\n\n\nSHERBERT: Nice to see you, Senator.\n\n\nACE: (To SHERBERT) Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.\n\n\nSHERBERT: Certainly. (Leads the way.) Senator.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Why not make them happy?\n\n\nSHERBERT: We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY The SENATOR unzips the HOOKER's dress, kisses her and walks through the bedroom doorway, looking over his shoulder to her as she takes off her dress and walks out of his sight.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) For politicians...\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - DAY ACE smoking a cigarette by the baccarat tables.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) ...like our state senator up there, everything was on the house.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY The SENATOR opens a bureau drawer and takes out a small velvet pouch and pours black $100 into his palm.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) These guys won their comped life when they got elected. So, hey, why not take advantage of it? Still, the politicians come cheap. We could handle them.\n\n\nINT. TANGIERS, ICHIKAWA LUXURY SUITE - DAY K. K. ICHIKAWA a Japanese businessman, and a male associate pick up towels and soap from about the bedroom of their suite. A blonde woman checks herself in the mirror.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) It's a whale like K. K. Ichikawa, who plays thirty thousand dollars a hand in baccarat. That's the one you really gotta watch.\n\n\nICHIKAWA and his associate walk into the the suite's living- room and join a Japanese woman seated on a couch.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) He plays fast and big and he has the cash and the credit to turn out your lights. About a year ago, he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands.\n\n\nThey begin to stuff Tangiers soap and towels into their luggage.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.) Downstairs, he takes us for two million... and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels. Another billionaire cheapskate who loves his free rooms...\n\n\nEXT.

TANGIERS JET, STILL IN THE SAME SPOT - NIGHT SHERBERT apologizes to ICHIKAWA and his entourage as they all get off the jet.\n\n\nSHERBERT: Ken, I don't know what the hell went wrong. I'm awfully sorry.\n\n\nICHIKAWA: This is a big problem. Big problem.\n\n\nSHERBERT: I can't understand it. These mechanical things, you know, they happen. Hey, be-better here than (gesturing to the sky) up there, you know what I mean?\n\n\nINT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT RESERVATION DESK - NIGHT SHERBERT arguing with TICKET AGENT as ICHIKAWA and entourage look glum.\n\n\nACE: (V.O.)
